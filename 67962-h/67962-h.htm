<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='pol'></a>THE POLISH MOTHER.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a gorgeous bridal. The old hall of the
palace was lit up with a thousand lights, and crowded
with all the wealth, beauty and rank of Poland. The
apartment blazed with the jewels of its occupants.
Princes with their proud dames, high officers of state,
nobles whose domains vied in extent with kingdoms,
and lordly beauties beneath whose gaze all bent in
adoration, had gathered at that magnificent festival
to do honor to the bridal of the fair daughter of their
host. And loveliest among the lovely was the bride.
Tall and majestic in every movement, with a queenly
brow, and a face such as might have been that of the
mother of the gods, she moved through the splendid
apartment the theme of every admiring tongue. Nor
less remarkable was her husband. Warsaw beheld
no noble tread her palaces more lordly in his bearing
than the Count Restchifky. The fire of a hundred
warrior ancestors burned in his eye. The fame
of his high lineage, of his extended possessions, of
his feats in arms, followed his footsteps wherever he
went. In manly beauty the court of Poland had no
rival to the count, in majestic loveliness the realm
furnished no equal to his bride. And now, as they
stood together in that proud old hall, surrounded by
all that was noble and beautiful in the land, the
peerless beauty of the countess and the princely
bearing of her husband shone pre-eminent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never had Warsaw seen such a festival. All that
the most boundless wealth and all that a taste the
most fastidious could do to add to the splendor of
the occasion had been done, and the guests, one and
all, bore testimony to the success of the princely
entertainer. The air was laden with incense, flowers
bloomed around, unseen music filled the hall with
harmony, and statues and carvings of rare device
met the eye at every turn. If Aladdin had been there
he would not have asked that his enchanted palace
should excel in magnificence the one before him.
No visionary, in his wildest dream, could imagine
aught more beautiful. And through this unrivalled
ball the count and his bride moved, conscious that all
this splendor was evoked for their honor, feeling that
not a heart in all the vast assembly but envied their
exalted lot. At every step congratulations met them
until they turned away sick with adulation. What
wonder that the rose grew still deeper on the cheek
of the bride, that her eyes flashed with brighter brilliancy,
or that her step became more queenly? Could
aught mortal wholly resist the intoxication of that
hour?</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&ensp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Years had elapsed. That fair young bride had become
a mother; but time had passed over her without
destroying one lineament of her majestic beauty. But
the scene had changed from that through which she
moved on her bridal night. There were no longer
around her wealth and splendor and beauty, the
flattery of the proud, the envy of the fair. She sat
alone—alone with her two children, one a lovely
girl of sixteen, and the other a smiling boy whose
birth three years before had thrilled her husband’s
heart with ecstasy, filled a province with rejoicings.
But now that husband was away from her side, that
province lay smoking around her. Her own proud
home, where since her marriage she had spent the
happiest hours of her life, had been sacked and
given to the flames, and she now sat leaning against
a shattered parapet, with her face buried in her
hands, and the bitter tear of a mother’s anguish rolling
down her cheeks. At her feet, leaning on her
for succor, and clasping her hand, sat her daughter;
while her boy, too young as yet to be conscious of the
misery around him, smiled as he played with the
jewelled cross depending from his mother’s neck.
A broken sword, a dismounted cannon, the shattered
staff of a lance, at the feet of the group, betokened
that the vassals of the count had not yielded up her
house to rapine without a deadly struggle; and indeed,
of the hundreds of hearts which beat there, but the day
before, only those of the mother and her two children
had escaped captivity or death. Part of the palace
was yet in flames, while, on the plain beyond, a village
threw its lurid conflagration across the sky.
Desolation and despair sat enthroned around. Who
that had seen that mother on her bridal night, could
have foretold that her after life would reveal a scene
like this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Polish war for independence had broken out.
Among the foremost of the patriotic band which perilled
all for their country, was the Count Restchifky.
His sword had been unsheathed at the outbreak of the
conflict, his fortune had been poured the first into the
coffers of the state. From his own estates he had
raised and equipped as gallant a band as ever followed
lord to the tented field. And for a short space
the war seemed to prosper. But then came the
reverse. From every quarter the haughty Catharine
poured her countless legions, headed by the fierce
Suwarrow, into Poland, and smoking fields and
slaughtered armies soon told that the day of hope for
that ill-fated land was over. Yet a few noble spirits,
among whom the count was foremost, still held out
for their country, fighting every foot of ground, and
though retreating before the overwhelming forces of
the foe, compelling him to purchase every rood of
land he gained by the lives of hundreds of his venal
followers. It was at this period, and while the count
was far from his home, that his palace had been
attacked, and given to the flames. Afar from succor,
unconscious whether or not her husband yet lived,
and trembling for the lives of her offspring amid the
desolation which surrounded them, what wonder that
even the proud heart of the countess gave way, and
that she wept in utter agony over her ruined country
and her dismantled home!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! mother,” said the daughter, “if we only
knew where father was, or if he yet lived, we might
still be happy. Wealth is nothing to us, for will we
not still love each other? Dry your tears, dear mother,
for something tells me that father lives and will
yet rejoin us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words of comfort, more soothing because
coming from a quarter so unexpected, the mother
looked up, and, drawing her daughter to her bosom,
kissed her, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, my child. We will hope for the
best. And if your father has indeed fallen, and we
are alone in the world, I will remember that I have
you to comfort me, and strive—to—be happy,” and,
in despite of her effort to be calm, the tears gushed
into her eyes at the bare thought of the possible loss
of her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But see, mother,” suddenly exclaimed the daughter,
“see the cloud of dust across the plain—can it
betoken the return of the foe?” and she drew close
to her mother’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother gazed with eager eyes across the plain,
and her cheek paled as she thought she distinguished
the banner of Russia borne in the advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, it is as I feared,” said the daughter, “they
come to carry us into captivity. Oh! let us hide
from their sight—there are secret recesses in the
ruins yet where we might defy scrutiny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the mother, all the spirit of her race
rising in her at this crisis, “no, my daughter, it
would not become us, like base-born churls, thus to
fly from a foe. The wife and children of Count Restchifky
will meet his enemies on his own hearth-stone,
all dismantled though it be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With these words she clasped her babe closer to
her bosom, and sat down again behind the parapet to
await, as the daughter of a hundred princes should
await, the approach of her murderers; and although
perhaps her cheek was a hue paler, the lofty glance
of her eye quailed not. Her daughter sank to her feet
and buried her face in her mother’s robe. But after
a few minutes she regained courage, and looked
timidly out across the plain. At the first glance she
started and said eagerly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But see, mother, can they really be enemies?
They wave their banners as if to us—they increase
their speed—surely, surely that gallant horseman in
the advance is my own dear father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment the mother gazed eagerly on the approaching
horseman, but a moment only. The eye
of the wife saw that her husband was indeed there,
and, with a glad cry, she clasped her children in her
arms and burst into a flood of joyful tears. She was
still weeping when the count, dismounting from his
charger, rushed forward and clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” he ejaculated, “you at least are
left to me. I had feared to find you no more. May
the lightning of heaven blast the cravens who could
thus desolate the home of a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband, oh! my husband!” was all that the
wife could say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, dear father, you are safe—oh! we shall
yet be happy,” said the daughter as she clung to her
restored parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father kissed and re-kissed them all, and for
once his stern nature was moved to tears, but they
were tears of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His story was soon told. Finding that all hope of
saving his country was over, and eager to learn the
fate of those he had left at home, he had cut his way
through the enemy with a few gallant followers. As
he drew near the vicinity of his palace, he had heard
strange rumors of the sacking of his home, and on
every side his own eyes beheld the ravages of the
foe. Torn with a thousand fears respecting the fate
of those he loved better than life, he had pressed
madly on, and when the blackened and smoking
walls of his palace had risen before him in the distance
he had almost given way to despair. But, at
length, his eager eye caught sight of a group amid
the ruins, and his heart told him that those he loved
remained yet to cheer his ruined fortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No pen can do justice to the feelings of gratitude
which throbbed in the bosom of that father as he
pressed his wife and children successively to his
heart. His plans were soon laid. He had, by remittances
to England on the outbreak of the war,
provided his family against want, and thither they
now bent their steps. Over his ruined country he
shed many a tear, but, at such times, the smiles of
his wife and children were ever ready to cheer his
despondency; and as he gazed on his lovely family
he felt that there was much yet in this world to bid
him be happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Saybrooke,” said a gentleman
named Creswell, meeting a friend; “I have just ascertained
to whom Collins is married—a lady of your
city—Laura Sands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amazing!” exclaimed Saybrooke, striking down
his cane with such energy that the other started;
“why, she is six feet high!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite,” returned Creswell, laughing; “and,
though somewhat large, she is one of the most
queenly looking women—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw! Victoria has put that word out of fashion,
or at least changed its signification.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon—I had forgotten your horror of
large women, or, rather, I did not regard it, supposing
it was your affectation—everybody has at least
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Affectation! take care, or I’ll raise my stick at
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is unaccountable that a man of your
inches should have such notions. Now, for a little
fellow, like myself, it would be bad taste to be following
women who might look as if they could flog
him, but with your six feet two, and abundant proportions,
the case is different. On the contrary, I
can’t imagine anything more comical than a little
wife hanging on your arm; she would look like a
reticule—not straining a pun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In saying I detest large women, I make no committal
by preferring very small ones; but, seriously,
I would no more expect to find a woman’s soul in all
its sweetness, delicacy and purity hidden in a coarse,
capacious body, than I could think of loving a woman
for the recommendation—‘<span class='it'>Sexu fæmina, ingenio
vir.</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There it is with you men of fortune! You become
so finical from having all sorts of attractions
paraded before you, that you stand still waiting for
perfection, till at last, in despair, you tie up your
eyes, and, like a child at blind man’s buff, spring forward
and secure the first against whom you stumble.
Now, we poor, hard-working dogs—but I’ll get out
of heart if I talk about my own grievances. I have
a lady selected for you, beautiful, accomplished,
with a thousand excellencies, and of station in society
and all that, just to suit, but this last freak has
chilled my good intentions. So good bye, till I get
into a better humor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening the two gentlemen met again, as
Saybrooke was coming out of an exchange office, in
the act of securing his pocket book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been filling or emptying that article,
which?” asked Creswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more agreeable alternative,” replied his
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are the very fellow I wished to see.
I have an appointment for you to-night—to take you
to a ladies’ fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mischief! when you know that fancy-fairs
are my aversion, and not from caprice but from real
principle. I don’t know anything more disgusting
than to see a room full of Misses, taking advantage
of some either really or nominally worthy purpose,
to exhibit themselves to the public, and to gratify a
petty and an indelicate vanity, by flirting over their
pincushions and doll-babies with any fellow who can
afford an admittance shilling for the honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, that’s really too severe, but just
now I have not time to take the other side of the
question. This, however, is no ordinary occasion.
It is an impromptu affair, undertaken by a number of
charming, whole-hearted girls, to raise a fund in aid
of the sufferers by a recent public disaster, and more
taste, enthusiasm, and liberality, I have never seen
exhibited. If you wish to see the <span class='it'>élite</span> of our beauty
and fashion, under the most favorable circumstances,
you had better avail yourself of my invitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is the case, I have no scruples. I intended
to appropriate a part of this very supply to a charity
so unquestionable, and it may as well pass through
the medium you have selected as any other. So I’m
at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the appointed time they reached the —— Saloon,
in which the fair was held, and Creswell, who
from previous visits was posted as to all concerning
it, led his friend, for a cursory inspection, around the
room. Its arrangements were novel and tasteful, its
decorations of the most rich and appropriate character,
and the fair projectors were fulfilling their duties
with a dignity, grace, and decorum that surprised as
well as gratified the fastidious stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, if you are satisfied,” said Creswell, “I’ll
give myself the trouble to advise you in the disposal
of that spare cash of yours—come to this table,” and
bowing to its fair attendant, he took up a large and
magnificently bound quarto volume, and turned over
its pages; “I have heard you express a fondness,
Saybrooke,” he continued, “for what you call the
only ladies’ science—Botany; did you ever see any
thing to equal this?” It was a collection of dried
flowers, of such as best preserve their color, pressed
with great niceness and skill, and pasted on the
smooth, white pages so carefully, some singly and
some in groups, that it required close examination to
distinguish them from delicate water-color drawings.
Beneath them were written, in an exquisite hand,
clear, full, and accurate technical descriptions, and
on intermediate pages quotations appropriate to their
symbolical characters, or fanciful and elegant passages,
evidently original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This must have been the work of a lady, judging
from its ingenuity and beauty,” said Saybrooke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was done by Miss Martha Grainger, was it
not?” asked Creswell, turning to the title page,
which was a graceful vignette, executed, even to the
lettering, in leaves and flowers, but it contained no
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” returned the pretty vender; “no
other of us could have had the taste, patience, and
knowledge for such a work, to say nothing of the
talent the literary illustrations display. I really think
it was a piece of heroism in her to give up a possession
so beautiful, and one that must have cost her a
world of labor and care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is not already sold, I shall be happy to become
its purchaser,” said Saybrooke; and paying for
his acquisition with much satisfaction, they walked
on. The next thing that struck their notice was a
large vase encrusted with shells, and filled with fragrant
and splendid flowers. It was white, and transparent
as alabaster, and of an antique form, as rare
as beautiful. Saybrooke examined it carefully.
“How superior,” said he, “to the unshapely,
crockery-looking ware commonly seen as shell-work—nothing
could be more perfectly elegant and
classical than it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it of your workmanship, Miss Ellen?” asked
Creswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry to say, very far from it. It is a donation
from Martha Grainger; she had just finished it
for herself, but, with her usual generous benevolence,
gave it up in hope that it might be turned to the
benefit of the unfortunate. The flowers, which you
seem to admire so much, Mr. Creswell, are also of
her culture. Her windows, you know, were the
rivals of the green-houses, but she robbed them all to
fill it. Suppose you take it for your office? There
is no one who will value it more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, if I could afford to have all I value! but I
would not desecrate anything so pure and sweet, by
stowing it away among the rough book-cases, and
dust, and cobwebs of a poor lawyer’s office. Now,
my friend here could give it a place not unworthy.
If it were placed within your curtains, Saybrooke,
I’d engage that you would have more bright eyes
peeping through your windows than you ever had
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The temptation is too strong to be resisted,” answered
Saybrooke, smiling, and he placed his card
in a handle of the vase, as its purchaser. “I am
glad to find that the botanical lady has a real love of
flowers,” he continued, as he walked away with a
China rose, which he had selected, in his hand; “it
is not always the case; a proficiency in the science
argues a clear and discriminating mind; the other
seems to belong to a naturally refined taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray, Mr. Creswell, can’t you find us a purchaser
for this?” asked a lady, pointing to a glass
case, which contained a set of elaborately carved
ivory chess-men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An exquisite set,” said Saybrooke, “they look
like fairy work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think this is not the first time I have seen them,
madam; can you remind me where they came
from?” said Creswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were added to our stock by Miss Grainger,
an effort of self-denial that I fear I never could have
attained. They were sent to her as a present by an
uncle in India, but she is so conscientious that she
offered them for our undertaking, saying that she
could not be satisfied to keep them for mere amusement,
when a set for ten dollars would answer as
well. Of course we cannot expect to get their real
value, as, very properly, there are few persons who
would offer a couple of hundred dollars for a thing of
the kind, but we are in hopes that some one willing
to aid the cause will take them at a price which, at
least, will not be unworthy of the generosity of the
donor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it is not very likely, from present appearances,”
said Saybrooke, “that the artists of the
Celestial Empire will have the courage and leisure
to execute toys so singularly elaborate and ingenious
for some time to come, I may as well avail myself of
the opportunity, and take possession of these. Will
this be sufficient for them, madam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, for your liberality,—it is more
than we expected;” said the lady, looking after the
stranger with much curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Miss Grainger must be a remarkable person
to be possessed of so much talent and industry,
and so much open-handed generosity. But what
have you there?” Creswell was looking at a pair
of small paintings which ornamented one of the stalls,
and Saybrooke continued, after joining him, “these
are really beautiful little things, and from their apparent
reference to the late calamity, they must have
been furnished expressly for this occasion. They
are evidently by the same hand, yet it must have
been difficult for one person to do them in so short a
time. There is much feeling, as well as originality,
in the designs, and not less spirit than grace in their
execution. May I ask, Miss, from whom these were
obtained?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are from the pencil of a lady, sir,—the all-accomplished
Miss Grainger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Grainger again!” said Saybrooke smiling;
“they are marked for sale, I believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are, sir, though we would prefer letting
them remain here till the sale is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly; but you will let me secure them in
time?” and having completed the purchase, he followed
Creswell; “there now,” said he, “I think I
have done my part, so I shall tie up my purse-strings;
but pray who is this Miss Grainger?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you imagine her to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An active, bustling, fussy old maid, such a person
who is always to be found in the like enterprises;
but in addition she must have an enlarged mind,
which, having freed her from the selfishness peculiar
to her relative position, still furnishes her with resources
to devote to general benevolence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never were more mistaken in your life,—but
what do you think of that oriental <span class='it'>kiosk</span> which
the ladies have fitted up as the post-office?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just going to remark that it is particularly
tasteful and beautiful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The plan is another of the labors of Miss Grainger,—but
we must ask for letters to finish our business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, but where is your fair <span class='it'>virtuoso</span>? you
must point her out to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, come along, and I’ll introduce you,
but of one thing I must apprise you beforehand,—with
all her admirable qualities she is, unfortunately,
quite—a large woman—the largest, I should think, in
the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is unfortunate,” said Saybrooke, looking
disturbed; “but as I wish merely to have my curiosity
gratified, and to pay a tribute of respect to an
intellectual and a useful woman, I shall put up with
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Creswell paused to speak with an acquaintance,
and Saybrooke walked forward. Suddenly a lady
swept by, almost jostling him, and of a size that over-shadowed
all around her. She was beflounced and
befurred, had a tall feather waving above her hat, a
decided shade on her upper lip, and a step like a
grenadier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Creswell, you needn’t mind taking
me to see Miss Grainger,—I don’t want to be introduced
to her,” said Saybrooke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have changed your mind very suddenly,”
returned Creswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me she was the largest woman in the
room, and by accident I have just met her. I recognized
her, of course, and my curiosity is amply gratified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Creswell followed his eye, and burst into an irrepressible
fit of laughter. “Oh, very well,” said he,
“if you are satisfied, so am I. But here is the post-office.
Anything here, ladies, for Stanley Saybrooke,
Esq.?—just excuse me, while you are waiting for
your letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postmistress was one of the youngest of the
association, and whilst she was searching, with
much archness and significancy, among the letters,
the eyes of Saybrooke fell upon a lady farther back
in the alcove, from whom a single look acted like magic
on him. The features were of a form and symmetry
the most faultlessly classical, and were radiant
with an expression of sweetness and intelligence.
Her eyes were large and of a soft blue, her complexion
was of the purest white and red, and her
hair, of a rich brown, fell in a single large curl,
smooth and glossy, down either side of her face.
She wore a small black velvet bonnet, which contrasted
strikingly with the pearliness of her skin,
and which, excepting in a little bordering of blond
around the face, was entirely without ornament.
Vexatiously, as our hero thought it, there was
nothing of her figure to be seen; she sat wrapped
in a large shawl, on an ottoman behind a table, and
appeared quite unconscious of attracting attention,
or, at least, indifferent to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a letter, sir;” said the officious little
postmistress, with a mischievous smile, but Saybrooke
stood unheeding; “there is nothing else, sir;”
she added, and recollecting himself, he walked reluctantly
away. The letter was a little poetical
bagatelle, to which he paid no attention, and reconnoitering
the <span class='it'>kiosk</span>, he placed himself where, by
keeping among the folds of a curtain, he might retain
a view of the face which had so much fascinated
him. Though, at his distance, he could not overhear
a word, he watched her quiet, yet neither cold
nor languid manner, to the many who approached
and addressed her. “What a lovely—lovely creature
she is!” thought he, “if I had not so long dropped
my school-boy notions of love at first-sight, I really
would believe myself captivated!—how calm she is!—how
unembarrassed and dignified, and yet how
gracious!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Creswell returned, but Saybrooke, ashamed to ask
a single question lest it might betray him, pleaded
fatigue, and declined walking farther, and his friend,
who had been watching him, to his secret amusement,
left him to the indulgence of his observations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the story of his liberality, exaggerated,
of course, had made its way over the room, and
many were the efforts of the fair promenaders to
catch the attention of a stranger so fashionable in
appearance, so handsome, and reportedly so rich;
but if he noticed the attractions of any, it was only
to remark how inferior they were to those he was so
intently contemplating. At length, to his extreme
delight, he observed that she had picked up the rose
which he had dropped on the table in his first bewilderment.
“What a dolt I have been,” said he
to himself; “after coming here to lay out money in
charity, to take and retain an equivalent for it!” and
to ease his conscience, he decided to get rid of the
vase. So calling a servant who was attending on
the tables, he directed him where to find it, and to
present it to the designated lady in the post-office,
with the compliments of a gentleman. He watched
as the commission was executed. There was no
flutter in the manner of the fair incognito, no wonder
nor exultation. She merely asked the man a question
or two, and dismissed him without a message. Her
bearing suited him to a charm. It was that of a sultana
receiving tribute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a hand—what an incomparable hand!”
was his next thought. One of his very few coxcomberies
was a passion for beautiful hands, and it
had its full gratification in the one which lay beside
his vase, with whose whiteness it did not suffer in
comparison. It was not small, but was exquisitely
shaped, full, smooth and tapering, with not an irregular
protuberance to detract from its graceful
outlines. It set his fancy at a new picture. He
imagined himself at his little mosaic chess-table—which
was so small that any two at it were in very
sociable proximity—and that snowy hand at the
other side. Then he looked at her forehead, which
was large and nobly developed—he was something
of a phrenologist—and he decided that she had a
genius for chess, consequently, that his recent purchase
of chess-men might thus be suitably transferred.
Accordingly, he hurried off to send it, but after he had
done so, he found, on returning, his place occupied
by a crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room had filled, and disappointed and abstracted
he wandered about for an hour before he
found an opportunity to speak to Creswell. The
latter at length approached him, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a message for you from a lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What lady?” asked Saybrooke, eagerly, hoping
it was <span class='it'>the</span> lady—the only one he cared about at the
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The one to whom you sent your vase and chess-men;
she says that if you don’t take them back she
will offer them for sale anew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she did not think me impertinent in sending
them?” said Saybrooke, looking alarmed, “how
did she discover that it was I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was easy to ascertain by whom they were
purchased, and she judged accordingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you know her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray introduce me, won’t you?—immediately, if
you please, my dear Creswell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather not. You won’t like her—for a
very <span class='it'>material</span> reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will—positively—I do like her—I’m half in
love already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With her face, you mean—that’s a pretty scrape
for a man of twenty-six to get into! however, I may
have an opportunity after a while, so be patient.
There’s a fine figure,” he continued, looking through
a glass he had picked up from a table, and then handing
it to Saybrooke—“there in that recess—the lady
with her back towards us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very fine, but the glass contracts too much; at
full size I dare say the proportions would scarcely
appear so perfect. Who is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A particular favorite of mine, the owner of this
shawl, which I am carrying to her. Come along,
and you shall have a nearer view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady was at the farther end of the saloon,
and with some difficulty they threaded their way
towards her. She was talking, and still had her back
towards them. “A fine figure, indeed,” said Saybrooke,
as they advanced, “but, she seems—isn’t
she rather large?—why, upon my word—Creswell—she
must be full five feet nine, if not ten!” and, putting
his arm through his friend’s, he was drawing him
in another direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! don’t jerk me off my feet, my dear fellow!”
said Creswell; “I must go on to deliver the shawl;
allow me, Miss Grainger,” he continued, “to present
my friend, Mr. Saybrooke—” and as the lady turned
round to curtsey, Saybrooke recognized the brilliant
face of the post-office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never was there a more instantaneous revolution.
“I’ll call you out for this night’s work!” whispered
Saybrooke, while the lady was replying to the parting
compliments of her former companions. Creswell
pretended to look very much surprised, and
after a little while, when he made a move to proceed,
Saybrooke gave him a deprecatory shake of the head,
at which they parted for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Creswell called at the lodgings
of his friend. “I am glad,” said he, “that you were
not disappointed in Miss Grainger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Disappointed!—she is the most fascinating
woman I ever met with—full of sweetness, feeling,
and intellect! I do not remember to have enjoyed a
conversation more in my life than the one we had as
I escorted her home last night”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Saybrooke! you certainly did not do that?
she is unquestionably large enough to take care of
herself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an impudent dog, Creswell,” returned
Saybrooke, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, seriously, Saybrooke, it is a great pity that
Miss Grainger is so large; to a man of your sentiments,
who never could see a woman over the medium
height without thinking of an ogress, it must
very much neutralize the effect of her unrivalled
face, her winning manners, and her delightfully
<span class='it'>spirituelle</span> conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll oblige me by remaining civilly quiet,
for a few minutes, I’ll tell you how I argued that
point. I stated to myself that the larger women I
had seen were as small ones examined through a
magnifying glass, every defect being thus rendered
more apparent. Now, I continued, here is a woman
of the magnified size, without a single defect, and
she is of course entitled to a magnified portion of admiration.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then I recollected that I was not the first
who had come to such a conclusion. That Juno
would not have looked the queen of Olympus had
she been other than a large woman—that had the rib
of Menelaus been but a small bone of contention,
Troy might have been standing to this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said Creswell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that a man must have a very contracted
imagination to fancy a little Venus De Medicis, a
little Cleopatra or a little Mary Stuart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>About six months after this, a gentleman and lady
passing, bowed to Creswell through his office window
while an acquaintance was sitting with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A magnificent looking couple—who are they?”
said the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The new bride and groom, Stanley Saybrooke,
and Martha Grainger, that was. By the by, I made
that match.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed! how did you accomplish it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just by persuading the lady to sit still for a few
hours. He had a most absurd aversion to large
women, and as I knew that Martha, who, in fact,
is a sort of cousin of mine, would suit him exactly in
other respects, I laid a plan to get him in love with
her before he found out her size, so I took him to a
fancy-fair, where he saw a great number of her productions,
and heard a great deal of her character,
and then I contrived to give him a sight of her
beautiful face, having, as I said, apprised her that
she would oblige me very much by keeping her seat
until I gave her notice. That finished the business.
He stared till he was conquered, and then the three
or four extra inches became very small matters
indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now, since they are married, won’t the defects
shoot up again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. I never saw a fellow so proud of a
wife. He says that a small casket could not contain
so lofty an intellect and so noble a heart!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “CRUISING IN THE LAST WAR,” THE “REEFER OF ’76,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE PRIVATEER.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I remained but a short time in <span class='sc'>the Arrow</span> after
we sailed finally from the port of ——; for happening
to fall in with and capture a rakish little schooner,
Captain Smyth resolved to arm and send her forth to
cruise against the enemy on her own account. A
long Tom was accordingly mounted on a pivot amidships,
a complement of men placed in her, and the
command given to our second lieutenant, with myself
for subordinate. Thus equipped, we parted company
from our consort, who bore away for the north, while
we were to cruise in the Windward Passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several days we met with no adventure. The
weather was intensely sultry. He who has never
witnessed a noontide calm on a tropical sea can have
no idea of the stifling heat of such a situation. The
sea is like molten brass; no breath of air is stirring;
the atmosphere is dry and parched in the mouth, and
the heavens hang over all their canopy of lurid fire,
in the very centre of which burns with intense fierceness
the meridian sun. The decks, the cabin, and
the tops are alike stifling. The awnings may indeed
afford a partial shelter from the vertical rays of the
sun, but no breeze can be wooed down the eager
windsail; while, wherever a stray beam steals to the
deck through an opening in the canvass, the turpentine
oozes out and boils in the heat, and the planks
become as intolerable to the tread as if a furnace was
beneath them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on one of the hottest days of the season, and
about a fortnight after we parted from <span class='sc'>the Arrow</span>,
that we lay thus becalmed. The hour was high
noon. I stood panting for breath by the weather
railing, dressed in a thin jacket and without a cravat,
feverishly looking out across the ocean to discern, if
possible, a mist or cloud or other evidence of an
approaching breeze. My watch was in vain. There
was no ripple on the deep, but a long monotonous
undulation heaved the surface of the water, which
glittered far and near like a mirror in which the sun
is reflected vertically, paining and almost blinding
the gaze. The schooner lay motionless on the ocean,
the shadow of her boom shivering in the wave, as the
swell undulated along. Silence reigned on the decks.
To a spectator at a distance, who could have beheld
our motionless shadow in the water, we would have
seemed an enchanted ship, hanging midway betwixt
the sea and sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noon passed, and the afternoon drew heavily along,
yet still no breeze arose to gladden our listless spirits.
Two bells struck and then three, but the same monotony
continued. Wearied out at length I was about
turning from the weather quarter to go below, when
I fancied I saw a sail far down on the horizon. I
paused and looked intently in the direction where the
welcome sight had been visible. For a moment the
glare of the sun and the water prevented me from
distinguishing with any accuracy whether what I
saw was really a sail or not, but at length my doubts
were removed by the cry of the look-out on the fore-castle,
and before half an hour it became evident
that the vessel to windward was a square-rigged
craft, but of what size or character it was impossible
to determine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must have had a puff of wind up yonder,”
remarked the second lieutenant to me, “or else they
could not have come within sight so rapidly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the breeze has left them ere this,” I said,
“for they have not moved for the last quarter of an
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall probably know nothing more of them
until nightfall, for the wind will scarcely make before
sunset, even if it does then. He has the weather
gauge. Until I know something more of him I
would rather change positions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is some fat merchantman,” I replied, “we
will lighten his plethoric pocket before morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the afternoon the calm continued, our craft
and the stray sail occupying their relative positions.
Meantime, innumerable were the conjectures which
we hazarded as to the character of our neighbor;
and again and again were our glasses put in requisition
to see if any thing could be discovered to decide
our conflicting opinions. But the royals of a ship, when
nothing else of her is visible, give scarcely any clue
as to her character; and accordingly hour after hour
passed away, and we were still altogether ignorant
respecting the flag and strength of our neighbor.
Toward sunset, however, signs of a coming breeze
began to appear on the seaboard, and when the luminary
wheeled his disc down the western line of the
horizon, the sea to windward was perceptibly ruffled
by the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! there it comes at last—” said the second
lieutenant, “and, by my halidome, the stranger is
standing for us. Now, if he will only keep in his
present mind until we can get within range of him, I
am no officer of the United Colonies if I do not give
him some hot work. By St. George, the men
have had so little to do of late, and they long so
eagerly to whet their palates, that I would venture to
attack almost twice our force—eh! Cavendish! You
have had such a dare-devil brush with the buccaneers
lately that I suppose you think no common enemy is
worth a thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether,” said I, “but I think we shall
have our wish gratified. Yonder chap is certainly
twice our size, and he carries his topsails as jauntily
as a man-of-war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith! and you’re right, Harry,” said my old
messmate, as he shut the glass with a jerk, after
having, in consequence of my last remark, taken a
long look at the strange sail, “that’s no sleepy merchantman
to windward. But we’ll swagger up to
him, nevertheless; one doesn’t like to run away
from the first ship he meets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not help smiling when I thought of the
excuses with which the lieutenant was endeavoring
to justify to himself his contemplated attack on a
craft that was not only more than twice our size, but
apparently an armed cruizer, for I knew the case
would have been the same if this had been the hundredth,
instead of the first vessel he had met after
assuming a separate command, as no man in the
corvette had been more notorious for the recklessness
with which he invited danger. Perhaps this
was the fault of his character. I really believe that
he would, if dared to it, have run into Portsmouth
itself, and fired the British fleet at anchor. In our
former days, when we had been fellow officers on
board <span class='sc'>the Arrow</span>, we had often differed on this
trait in his character, and perhaps now he felt called
on, from a consciousness of my opinion, to make
some excuse to me for his disregard of prudence in
approaching the stranger; for, as soon as the breeze
had made, he had close-hauled the schooner, and,
during the conversation I have recorded, we were
dashing rapidly up towards the approaching ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we drew nearer to the stranger, my worst suspicions
became realized. Her courses loomed up
large and ominous, and directly her hammock nettings
appeared, and then her ports opened to our
view, six on a side; while, almost instantaneously
with our discovery of her force, a roll of bunting
shot up to her gaff, and, unrolling, disclosed the cross
of St. George. There was now no escape. The
enemy had the weather gauge, and was almost within
closing distance. However prudent a more wary
approach might have been hitherto, there was no
longer any reason for the exercise of caution. It
would be impossible for us now to avoid a combat,
or get to windward by any manœuvre; and to have
attempted to escape by going off before the wind
would have been madness, since of all points of sailing
that was the worst for our little craft. Gloomy,
therefore, as the prospect appeared for us, there was
no hesitation, but each man, as the drum called us to
quarters, hurried to his post with as much alacrity as
if we were about to engage an inferior force, instead
of one so overwhelmingly our superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon had by this time risen and was calmly
sailing on, far up in the blue ether, silvering the deep
with her gentle radiance, and showering a flood of
sparkles on every billowy crest that rolled up and
shivered in her light. Everywhere objects were discernible
with as much distinctness as under the noon-day
sun. The breeze sang through our rigging with
a joyous sound, singularly pleasing after the silence
and monotony of the day; and the waves that parted
beneath our cut-water rolled glittering astern along
our sides, while ever and anon some billow, larger
than its fellows, broke over the bow, sending its foam
crackling back to the foremast. Around the deck
our men were gathered, each one beside his allotted
gun, silently awaiting the moment of attack. The
cutlasses had been served out; the boarding pikes
and muskets were placed convenient for use; the
balls had already been brought on deck; and we only
waited for some demonstration on the part of the foe
to open our magazine and commence the combat in
earnest. At length, when we were rapidly closing
with him, the enemy yawed, and directly a shot
whistled high over us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too lofty by far, old jackanapes,” said the captain
of our long Tom, “we’ll pepper you after a different
fashion when it comes to our turn to serve out
the iron potatoes. Ah! the skipper’s tired of being
silent,” he continued, as Mr. Vinton ordered the old
veteran to discharge his favorite piece, “we’ll soon
see who can play at chuck-farthing the best, my
hearty. Bowse away, boys, with that rammer—now
we have her in a line—a little lower, just a trifle
more—that’s it—there she goes;” and as he applied
the match, the flame streamed from the mouth of the
gun, a sharp, quick report followed, and the smoke,
clinging a moment around the piece in a white mass,
broke into fragments and eddied away to leeward on
the gale; while the old veteran, stepping hastily
aside, placed his hand over his eyes, and gazed after
the shot, with an expression of intense curiosity
stamped on every feature of his face. Directly an
exulting smile broke over his countenance, as the
fore-top-sail of the ship fell—the ball having hit the
yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the holy and thrue cross,” said a mercurial
Irishman of the old veteran’s crew, “but he has it
there—hurrah! Give it to him nately again—it’s
the early thrush that catches the early worm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home with the ball there, my hearties,” sung
out the elated veteran, “she is yawing to let drive at
us—there it comes. Give her as good as she sends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enemy was still, however, at too great a distance
to render her fire dangerous, and after a third
shot had been exchanged betwixt us—for the stranger
appeared to have, like ourselves, but a single long
gun of any weight—this distant and uncertain firing
ceased, and both craft drew steadily towards each
other, determined to fight the combat, as a gallant
combat should be fought, yard arm to yard arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had now freshened considerably, and we
made our way through the water at the rate of six
knots an hour. This soon brought us on the bows of
the foe. Our guns, meanwhile, had been hastily
shifted from the starboard to the larboard side, so
that our whole armament could be brought to bear at
once on the ship. As we drew up towards the enemy
a profound silence reigned on our deck—each man,
as he stood at his gun, watching her with curious
interest. We could see that her decks were well
filled with defenders, and that marksmen had been
posted in the tops to pick off our crew. But no eye
quailed, no nerve flinched, as we looked on this formidable
array. We felt that there was nothing left
for us but to fight, since flight was alike dishonorable
and impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length we were within pistol shot of the foe,
and drawing close on to his bows. The critical moment
had come. That indefinable feeling which even
a brave man will feel when about engaging in a
mortal combat, shot through our frames as we saw
that our bowsprit was overlapping that of the enemy,
and knew that in another minute some of us would
perhaps be in another world. But there was little
time for such reflections now. The two vessels,
each going on a different tack, rapidly shot by each
other, and, in less time than I have taken to describe
it, we lay broadside to broadside, with our bows on
the stern of the foe, and our tafferel opposite his foremast.
Until now not a word had been spoken on
board either ship; but the moment the command
to fire was passed from gun to gun, a sheet of flame
instantaneously rolled along our sides, making our
light craft quiver in every timber. The rending of
timbers, the crash of spars, and the shrieks of the
wounded, heard over even the roar of battle, told us
that the iron missiles had sped home, bearing destruction
with them. A momentary pause ensued, as if
the crew of the enemy had been thrown into a temporary
disorder—but the delay was only that of a
second or two—and then came in return the broadside
of the foe. But this momentary disorder had
injured the aim of the Englishman, and most of his
balls passed overhead, doing considerable injury
however to the rigging. Our men had lain flat on
the deck after our discharge, since our low bulwarks
afforded scarcely any protection against the fire of
the enemy, and when, therefore, his broadside came
hurtling upon us, the number of our wounded was
far less than under other circumstances would have
been possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God! the first broadside is over,” I involuntarily
exclaimed, “and we have the best of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza! we’ll whip him yet, my hearties,” shouted
the captain of our long Tom; “give it to him with
a will now—pepper his supper well for him. Old
Marblehead, after all, against the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the word our men sprang up from the decks,
and waving their arms on high, gave vent to an enthusiastic
shout ere they commenced re-loading their
guns. The enemy replied with a cheer, but it was
less hearty than that of our own men. Little time,
however, was lost on either side in these bravados;
for all were alike conscious that victory hung, as yet,
trembling in the scales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with her—aye! there she has it,” shouted
a grim veteran in my division, “down with the rascally
Britisher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza for St. George,” came hoarsely back in
reply, as the roar of the gun died on the air, and, at
the words, a ball whizzed over my shoulders, and
striking a poor fellow behind me on the neck, cut the
head off at the shoulders, and while it bore the skull
with it in its flight, left the headless trunk spouting its
blood, as if from the jet of an engine, over the decks.
I turned away sickened from the sight. The messmates
of the murdered man saw the horrid sight, but
they said nothing, although the terrible energy with
which they jerked out the gun, told the fierceness of
their revengeful feelings. Well did their ball do its
mission; for as the smoke eddied momentarily away
from the decks of the enemy, I saw the missile dismount
the gun which had fired the last deadly shot,
scattering the fragments wildly about, while the
appalling shrieks which followed the accident told
that more than one of the foe had suffered by that
fatal ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve revenged poor Jack, my lads,” said the
captain of the gun,—“away with her again. A few
more such shots and the day’s our own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The combat was now at its height. Each man of our
crew worked as if conscious that victory hung on his
own arm, nor did the enemy appear to be less determined
to win the day. The guns on either side were
plied with fearful rapidity and precision. Our craft
was beginning to be dreadfully cut up, we had received
a shot in the foremast that threatened momentarily
to bring it down, and at every discharge of
the enemy’s guns one or more of our little crew fell
wounded at his post. But if we suffered so severely
it was evident that we had our revenge on the foe.
Already his mizzen-mast had gone by the board, and
two of his guns were dismounted. I fancied once
or twice that his fire slackened, but the dense canopy
of smoke that shrouded his decks and hung on the
face of the water prevented me from observing, with
any certainty, the full extent of the damage we had
done to the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some minutes longer the conflict continued
with unabated vigor on the part of our crew; but at
the end of that period, the fire of the Englishman
sensibly slackened. I could scarcely believe that
our success had been so decisive, but, in a few minutes
longer, the guns of the enemy were altogether
silenced, and directly afterwards a voice hailed from
him, saying that he had surrendered. The announcement
was met by a loud cheer from our brave tars,
and, as the two vessels had now fallen a considerable
distance apart, the second lieutenant determined to
send a boat on board and take possession. Accordingly,
with a crew of about a dozen men, I pushed
off from the sides of our battered craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we drew out of the smoke of the battle we
began to see the real extent of the damage we had
done. The ship of the enemy lay an almost perfect
wreck on the water, her foremast and mizzen-mast
having both fallen over her side; while her hull was
pierced in a continuous line, just above water mark,
with our balls. Here and there her bulwarks had
been driven in, and her whole appearance betokened
the accuracy of our aim. I turned to look at the
schooner. She was scarcely in a better condition,
for the foremast had by this time given way, and her
whole larboard side was riddled with the enemy’s
shot. A dark red stream was pouring out from her
scuppers, just abaft the mainmast. Alas! I well knew
how terrible had been the slaughter in that particular
spot. I turned my eyes from the melancholy spectacle,
and looked upwards to the calm moon sailing
in the clear azure sky far overhead. The placid
countenance of the planet seemed to speak a reproof
on the angry passions of man. A moment afterward
we reached the captured ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I stepped on deck I noticed that not one solitary
individual was to be seen; but in the shattered gun-carriage,
and the dark stains of blood on the deck, I
beheld the evidences of the late combat. The whole
crew had apparently retreated below. At this instant,
however, a head appeared above the hatchway and
instantly vanished. I was not long in doubt as to the
meaning of this strange conduct, for, almost immediately
a score of armed men rushed up the hatchway,
and advancing toward us demanded our surrender. I
saw at once the dishonorable stratagem. Stung to
madness by the perfidy of the enemy, I sprang back a
few steps to my men, and rallying them around me,
bid the foe come on. They rushed instantly upon us,
and in a moment we were engaged in as desperate a
<span class='it'>mêlée</span> as ever I had seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand fast, my brave lads,” I cried, “give not
an inch to the cowardly and perfidious villains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cut him down, and sweep them from the decks,”
cried the leader of the men, stung to the quick by
the taunt of cowardice. “St. George against the
rebels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brawny desperado at the words made a blow at
me with his cutlass, but hastily warding it off I
snatched a pistol from my belt, and fired at my antagonist,
who fell dead to the deck. The next instant
the combat became general. Man to man, and foot
to foot, we fought, desperately contesting every inch
of deck, each party being conscious that the struggle
was one of life or death. The clashing of cutlasses,
the crack of fire-arms, the oaths, the shouts, the
bravado, the shrieks of the wounded, and the dull
heavy fall of the dead on the deck, were the only
sounds of which we were conscious during that terrible
<span class='it'>mêlée</span>, and these came to our ears not in
their usual distinctness, but mingled into one fearful
and indescribable uproar. For myself, I scarcely
heard the tumult. My whole being was occupied in
defending myself against a Herculean ruffian who
seemed to have singled me out from my crew, and
whom it required all my skill at my weapon to keep
at bay. I saw nothing but the ferocious eye of my
adversary; I heard only the quick rattle of our blades.
I have said once before that my proficiency at my
weapon had passed into a proverb with my messmates,
and had I not been such a master of my art,
I should, on the present occasion, have fallen a victim
to my antagonist. As it was, I received a sharp
wound in the arm, and was so hotly pressed by my
vigorous foe that I was forced to give way. But this
temporary triumph proved the destruction of my antagonist.
Flushed with success, he forgot his wariness,
and made a lunge at me which left him unprotected.
I moved quickly aside, and, seizing my advantage,
had buried my steel in his heart before his
own sword had lost the impetus given to it by his
arm. As I drew out the reeking blade, I became
aware, for the first time, of the wild tumult of sounds
around me. A hasty glance assured me that we barely
maintained our ground, while several of my brave
fellows lay on the deck wounded or dying; but before
I could see whether the ranks of the foe had been
equally thinned, and while yet scarcely an instant
had passed since the fall of my antagonist, a loud,
clear huzza, swelling over the din of the conflict,
rose at my side, and, turning quickly around, I saw
to my joy that the shout proceeded from a dozen of
our tars who had reached us at that moment in a boat
from the schooner. In an instant they were on deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down with the traitors—no quarter—hew them
to the deck,” shouted our indignant messmates as
they dashed on the assailants. But the enemy did
not wait to try the issue of the combat. Seized with
a sudden panic, they fled in all directions, a few
jumping overboard, but most of them tumbling headlong
down the hatchways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were now masters of the deck. As I instantly
guessed, the report of the fire-arms had been heard
on board the schooner, when, suspecting foul play, a
boat had instantly pushed off to our rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A narrow escape, by Jove!” said my messmate
who had come to my aid, “these traitorous
cowards had well nigh overpowered you, and if they
could have cut your little party off they would, I
suppose, have made another attempt on the schooner—God
confound the rascals!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your arrival was most opportune,” said I, “a
few minutes later and it would have been of no
avail.” And then, as I ran my eye over our comparatively
gigantic foe, I could not restrain the remark,
“It is a wonder to me how we conquered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith, and you may well say that,” laughingly
rejoined my messmate; “it will be something to talk
of hereafter. But the schooner hasn’t come off,”
he added, glancing at our craft, “without the marks
of this fellow’s teeth. But I had forgot to ask who
or what the rascal is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prize proved to be a privateer. She had received
so many shot in her hull, and was already
leaking so fast, that we concluded to remove the
prisoners and blow her up. Her crew were accordingly
ordered one by one on deck, handcuffed, and
transferred to the schooner. Then I laid a train,
lighted it and put off from the prize. Before I
reached our craft—which by this time had been removed
to some distance—the ship blew up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rigged a jury mast, and by its aid reached
Charleston, where we refitted. Our capture gave us
no little reputation, and while we remained in port
we were lionized to our hearts’ content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eager, however, to continue the career so gloriously
begun, we staid at Charleston no longer than
was absolutely necessary to repair our damages. In
less than a fortnight we left the harbor, and made
sail again for the south.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A SCENE FROM REAL LIFE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY ROBERT MORRIS.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene was one of mirth, and joy, and loveliness,
and beauty. Two spacious parlors had been
thrown open in one of the largest houses in Arch
street. Lights had glittered in the various chambers
since early sundown—carriages by dozens had driven
up to the door, each freighted with friends or relatives,
so that the world without found little difficulty
in arriving at the conclusion that some extraordinary
scene of festivity was in progress within the walls
of that spacious mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about nine o’clock when we entered. The
two large parlors, brilliantly illuminated by gas,
and glittering with a rich collection of young and
beautiful females, each dressed in the most tasteful
or gorgeous manner, presented a scene truly magnificent.
For a moment the eye seemed to quail
before the general flash, while the mind also grew
dizzy; but these feelings lasted but for the instant,
as friends were to be met on all sides, and we soon
found ourselves mingling in the giddy and trifling
conversation that too many of our fair countrywomen
seem to delight in on such occasions. Still, as the
first flash passed by, we paused to contemplate the
scene in a calmer and more meditative spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party was a “Bridal” one, and the bride was
the daughter of one of our most respectable merchants,
a worthy, good-hearted man, who had
devoted himself to his business, and paid no attention
whatever to the frivolities of fashionable life. The
bride seemed <span class='it'>very</span> young—not more than sixteen or
seventeen. She could not be regarded as beautiful
in the general appreciation of the word, and yet she
had one of the sweetest faces that we ever saw.
She had soft blue eyes, brown hair which fell over
her shoulders in ringlets, a pretty and expressive
mouth, with teeth that appeared to us faultless. Her
complexion was clear, but her face looked rather
pale, although at times it became flushed and ruddy
as the rose. Her dress was of the richest white
satin, and the ornaments of her hair and neck and
wrists consisted almost exclusively of pearls. Her
frame was slight and full of symmetry, and her voice
was remarkable for the gentleness and amiability of
its tone. We gazed upon her calmly for many
minutes, and the thought passed through our mind—“So
young, so fair, so delicate, so happy, and yet so
willing to enter upon the severe responsibilities of
the wife and the mother.” “Who,” we inquired of
ourselves, “may read that young creature’s destiny?
Doubtless she loves the object of her choice with a
woman’s virgin and devoted love—doubtless she
believes that the next sixteen years of her life will
prove radiant with happiness, even more so than the
girlish and sunny period which has but just gone by—and
doubtless the youth who has won that gentle heart
believes that he possesses the necessary requisites
of mind and disposition to render her happy. And
yet how often has the bright cup of joy been
dashed from the lips of woman when about to quaff
it! How often does man prove recreant and false!
How often is he won from his home and his young
wife, whose heart gives way slowly, but fatally and
steadily, under the influence of such indifference and
neglect!” But we paused and dismissed these
gloomy reflections. The nuptial ceremony was pronounced—for
a moment all was breathless silence—and
then the busy hum broke forth as audibly as
ever. The wedding was a brilliant one in all respects.
It was followed up by party after party, so
that nearly a month rolled away before the giddy
round was over. The only one who did not appear
to mingle fully in the general feeling, was the mother
of the bride. She loved her daughter so tenderly
that it seemed impossible for her to consign
her to other hands. She was one of those women
who devote themselves wholly to their children, and
who have no world without them. On the night of
the wedding, a tear would occasionally roll down
her cheek as she gazed upon her chaste child, and
as a tide of maternal recollections melted all her
soul!</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>The world rolled on. We frequently saw the
young bride in the streets, and her cousin, who was
our immediate neighbor, spoke of her prospects as
cheering and happy. But one evening, just after
sundown, and less than a year since we had seen
each other at the wedding, he called, and with rather
a grave aspect invited us to accompany him for a
few minutes to the house of his aunt—the same
house that had glittered with so much light, and re-echoed
with so much laughter on the night of the
Bridal. We proceeded along calmly, for although
somewhat struck by the sedate aspect of our friend,
it did not excite much surprise. On arriving at the
house, the first objects that attracted attention were
the closed and craped windows, and the awful
silence that seemed to “breathe and sadden all
around.” Our friend still refrained from speaking,
but led on to the <span class='it'>Chamber of Death</span>! Our worst
apprehensions were realized. The fair young creature,
who less than a year before had stood before
us radiant with loveliness and hope, was now still,
pale, and cold in the icy embrace of death. Her last
agonies were dreadful, but the sweet, soft smile,
that told of a gentle heart, still lingered on her features.
Her infant survived,—but the sudden decease
of that cherished one shed a gloom over that home
and its happy household, which is not yet totally dispelled.
The windows of the dwelling are still
bowed, and the afflicted mother, although a sincere
Christian, and anxious to yield in a Christian spirit
to the decrees of Divine Providence, frequently finds
herself melting in tears, and her whole soul convulsed
with grief at the memory of her dear <span class='it'>Clara</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>And such are human hopes and expectations!</span></p>

<div><h1><a id='lig'></a>THE LIGHTNING OF THE WATERS.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY DR. REYNELL COATES.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are few phenomena observable on the
ocean, more striking than the phosphorescence of
the water, when seen in high perfection. It has
forcibly attracted the attention of poets and philosophers
in all ages, and many and curious have been
the speculations of those who have endeavored to
explain the brilliant apparition. In later times,
however, the progress of natural science has dissipated
the mystery to a considerable extent, destroying
a portion of its romantic interest, without,
thereby, diminishing its exquisite beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are well informed, at present, that all the brilliant
pyrotechny of Neptune is the effect of animal
secretion, not differing essentially in cause from
that which ornaments our groves and meadows,
when the glow-worms of Europe, the fire-flies of
North America, or the fulgoure of the Indies are
lighting their fairy love-lanterns beneath the cool,
green leaves, or filling the air with their mimic
meteors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To those who are not familiar with microscopic
researches, it may seem almost impossible that animal
life can be multiplied to such excess in the
transparent waters, where not a mote is visible by
daylight, as to give rise to the broad and bright illumination
of the sea, so frequently observed within
the lower latitudes; and many, for this reason, have
attributed these night-fires of the deep to the impurity
and occasional fermentation of the ocean,—a
cause which they esteem more nearly commensurate
with the magnificence of the result. Such theorists
regard this phosphorescence as similar to that so
constantly produced by putrifying fish and decaying
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These ideas, as I have stated, are no longer tenable,
and the real origin of the phenomenon is better
understood. But even now, the few who have witnessed
it in full extent, variety, and grandeur—a
privilege rarely enjoyed, except by those who have
made long voyages, and have become familiar with
many seas—are lost in wonder; and, unless professionally
devoted to the study of natural history, they
find it difficult to credit the assertion, that all these
vast displays are mere results of living action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may prove interesting, then, to those who are
fond of such investigations, to offer some remarks on
the multitudinous character of those tribes of simple
and transparent beings, which swarm about the surface
of the ocean, and may be found continually
changing in race and habits, with almost every degree
of latitude we traverse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you will take the trouble, on some suitable occasion
during the month of November or December,
to descend into a <span class='it'>fashionable oyster cellar</span>, and ask
admission to the pile of freshly opened shells stowed
in the usual receptacle, which is in some dark vault or
closet about the premises, you may chance to witness,
on a diminutive scale, the far-famed phosphorescence
of the sea, without enduring the heavy
<span class='it'>immigration tax</span> levied, with unrelenting severity,
by the old trident-bearer upon all novices, except,
perhaps, a few fortunate favorites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take up the shovel that leans against the wall,
order the light removed and the door closed, and
then proceed to disturb the shells. If they have been
taken from the water, where it is purely salt,—and
still more certainly if gathered from the beds of blue
marine mud that are the favorite resort of the finest
oysters—the moment you throw a shovelful upon
the top of the pile, the whole mass, jarred by the
blow, will become spangled with hundreds of brilliant
stars—not in this case pale and silvery, but
of the richest golden-green or blue. None of these
stars may equal in size the head of the finest pin;
but so intense is the light emitted by them, that a
single, and scarcely visible point will sometimes
illuminate an inch of the surrounding surface, even
casting shadows from the little spears of sea-grass
growing in its neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choose one of the most conspicuous of these diminutive
tapers, and, without removing it from the
shell, carry it towards the gas-lamp. As you approach,
the brilliancy of the star declines; and when
the full flood of light is thrown upon the shell, it
nearly, or entirely disappears. If you press your
finger rudely upon the spot, you will again perceive
the luminous matter diffused, like a fluid, over the
surrounding surface, and shining, for an instant,
more brightly than ever, even under the immediate
glare of the gas. Then all is over. You have crushed
one of the glow-worms of the deep—an animal, once
probably as vain of his golden flame as you of any
of your brilliant endowments—perhaps some sentinel
there stationed to alarm his sleeping brethren of
the approach of danger—perhaps an animalcular
Hero trimming her solitary lamp to guide her chosen
one, through more than Leander’s dangers, along
the briny path to her rocky bower, beset by all the
microscopic monsters of the corallines! At all
events, despise it as you may, this little being was
possessed of life, susceptible of happiness, and endowed
with power to outshine, with inborn lustre,
the richest gem in Europe’s proudest diadem!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sea is filled in many regions, and at various
seasons, with incalculable multitudes of living creatures,
in structure much resembling this little parasite,
but often vastly more imposing in dimensions.
The smallest tribes that are able to call attention
to their individual existence generally wander, like
erratic stars, beneath the waves. They may be
seen by thousands shooting past the vessel, on evenings
when the moon is absent or obscured, suddenly
lighting their torches when the motion of the bow
produces a few curling swells and breakers on
either hand, and whirling from eddy to eddy, as they
sweep along the side and are lost in the wake. From
time to time the vessel, in her progress, disturbs
some large being of similar powers, who instantly
ejects a trail of luminous fluid which, twining, and
waving about among contending currents, assumes
the semblance of a silver snake. But the most surprising
of all proofs of the infinity of life is furnished
by those inconceivably numerous bands of shining
animalcules, too small for human vision, which in
their aggregate effect perform, perhaps, the grandest
part in beautifying the night scene on the ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crest of every wave emits a pale and milky
light and every ripple that, urged onward too rapidly
before the breeze, expires in spreading its little patch
of foam upon the water, increases the mysterious
brightness. On a starless evening the novice may
find it very difficult to account for the distinctness
with which even the distant billows may be traced
by their whitened summits, while every other object
is thrown into the deepest shade. The gentle radiation
from within the foam deceives the eye:—it
seems a mere reflection from the surface; and he
turns again and again towards the heavens, with the
constantly renewed impression, that the moon
has found some transient opening in the cloudy
canopy through which descends a thin pencil of rays
to be glinted back from the edges of the waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though certain portions of the ocean, generally,
present but slender proofs of phosphorescence,—such
being peculiarly the case within the gloomy
limits of the Gulf Stream, for reasons not to
be appropriately mentioned here—yet no observing
person can have passed a week upon the ocean, or
rowed his skiff by night on any of our principal harbors,
without becoming familiar with most of the
appearances to which allusion has been made. A mere
voyage to Europe frequently presents much grander
examples; but he who would enjoy the view of the
phenomenon in its fullest glory, must “cross earth’s
central line” “and brave the stormy spirit of the
Cape.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me transport you for a few moments into the
midst of the Indian Ocean! The sultry sun of February
has been basking all day upon the heated
waters from a brassy sky without a cloud—the vapors
of the upper regions resembling a thin veil of
dust, fiery and glowing, as if recently ejected from
the mouth of some vast furnace! But the tyrant
has gone to his repose, and we enjoy some respite
from his scorching influence. It is not cool, but the
temperature is tolerable, <span class='it'>and this is much</span>! Leave
the observation of the barometer to the captain!
You cannot prevent a hurricane, should it be impending.
Then trust such cares to those in whom is
vested the responsibility, and come on deck with
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no moon—but the “sentinel stars” are all
at their post. Observe those broad flashes reflected
upward from beneath the bows, and playing brightly
upon the jib! At every plunge of the vessel, as she
sinks into the trough of the sea, you might read a
volume fluently by that mild radiance; and beautiful
indeed is the view from the fore stay-sail nettings,
looking down upon the curling wreaths on either
side of the cut-water, and the long lines of foam
thrown off by the swell as the vessel gracefully
breasts the coming wave, all glowing like molten
silver intermingled with a thousand diamonds!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I will not lead you thitherward—a noble sight
awaits us in our wake. Step to the stern and lean
with me over the taffrail. What a glorious vision!
For miles abaft, our course presents one long and
wide canal of living light—the clear, blue ocean,
transparent as air, filling it to repletion; while the
darker waters around appear like some dense medium
through which superior spirits have constructed
this magic path-way for us and us alone, so nicely
are its breadth and depth adjusted to the form of our
gallant bark. Has not the galaxy been torn from
heaven, and whelmed beneath the waves to form
that burning road? No! no! Though thousands of
bright orbs are set in that nether firmament to
strengthen the delusion, yet it cannot be. Night’s
stormy cincture never gleamed like this, nor bore
such dazzling gems. There it still glimmers with
its myriad sparks, athwart the dark blue vault, paled
by the radiance of its sea-born rival, while huge
globes of fire roll from beneath the keel, and blaze
along the silvery track like showers of wandering
meteors, but all too gentle in their aspect to be
deemed of evil-augury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those stars are literally <span class='it'>living stars</span>,—that ocean
galaxy is formed of living beings only,—and even
those meteors, invisible by day, except when they
approach unusually near to the surface, are active
in pursuit of prey. Observe one closely, and you
perceive its motions. Formed like a great umbrella
of transparent jelly, with fibres, yards in length,
trailing from its margin, and the handle carved into
a beautiful group of leaves, it flaps its way regularly
through the water with a stately march, and wo to
the unfortunate creature that becomes involved in
the meshes of its stinging tendrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is no exaggerated picture, for such are the
beautiful phenomena occasionally witnessed in the
Indian and Pacific Oceans. The animals upon whose
agency they are dependent, generally become invisible
by daylight in consequence of their transparency;
but there are certain tribes among them whose peculiar
structure renders them conspicuous: and of these
one of the most remarkable is known to naturalists by
the title of Salpa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many species of the salpæ, but they
bear a closer likeness to each other than do most of
these simple tribes of being. In form they all resemble
diminutive purses, composed of highly transparent
jelly, with wide mouths like the ordinary clasp—and
strengthened by a net-work of ribbons interwoven
with the general texture of the purse. These are
designed to supply the place of muscles. The salpæ
move through the water by contracting the net-work,
so as to render the cavity smaller and expel the water
from it with some force; then, relaxing the fibres,
they allow their natural elasticity to expand them to
their original form; thus drawing in a fresh supply
of fluid with which to renew the effort. In this manner
they are driven onward, always retreating from
the principal orifice of the sac. But I will not detain
you with a detailed description of their singular organization.
It is enough for our present purpose to
state that near the bottom of the purse, within the
thickness of its walls, there is a golden spot, as if a
solitary coin was there deposited. This spot alone
enables us to see the animal distinctly when floating
in the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When young, these little creatures adhere together
in strings or cords arranged like the leaflets of a pinnated
leaf, in consecutive pairs, to the number of
twenty or more. At that period, the most common
species in the South Atlantic rarely exceed one half
an inch in length, and the yellow spot hardly equals
in size an ordinary grain of sand; yet, in certain
regions of the ocean these salpæ swarm in such
inconceivable multitudes that the sea assumes the
appearance of a sandy shoal for miles in length and
breadth. To the depth of many fathoms their delicate
bodies are closely huddled together, until the
constant repetition of the diminutive colored spots
renders the water perfectly opaque, and so increases
its consistence that the lighter ripple of the surface
breaks upon the edge of the animated bank, while the
heavier billows roll on smoothly, with the regular and
more majestic motion of the ground swell. In passing
through such tracts the speed of the vessel is sometimes
sensibly checked by the increased resistance of
the medium in which she moves; and when a bucket
full of brine is lifted from the sea, it may contain a
larger portion of living matter than of the fluid in
which it floats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There can be no reasonable doubt that most of
those false shoals which disfigure the older charts—their
existence proved upon authorities of known
veracity and denied by others no less credible—have
really been laid down by navigators who have met
with beds of salpæ, and were ignorant of their true
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have never seen these animals emitting light, but
it is well known that many phosphorescent animalcules
shine only in certain stages of the weather or
at certain seasons of the year: and as several distinguished
travellers have spoken of their luminous
properties, it is at least probable that they or their
congeners act an important part in dramas similar to
that which has been just described. At all events,
their history clearly shows the vastness of the scale
of animal existence in the superficial waters of the
ocean. But for the little yellow spot within their
bodies, they would be totally invisible at the distance
of a few feet in their native fluid, and could not
interfere appreciably with the progress of the rays
of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If further proof were necessary to show the incalculable
increase of many oceanic tribes, it might be
found in the history of living beings much more familiar
to the mariner. Most persons have met with
notices of the Portuguese man-of-war, called, by naturalists
<span class='it'>physalia</span>, a living air sac of jelly provided
with a sail, armed with a multitude of dependant bottle
shaped stomachs, all capable of seizing prey, and
colored more beautifully than the rainbow. This
splendid creature pursues its way over the waves with
all the skill of an accomplished pilot, and furnishes,
when caught, one of the most astonishing examples of
the adaptation of animal structure to the peculiar
wants, and theatre of action of living beings, one of the
most striking evidences of Omniscient Wisdom which
nature offers to the moralist. The physalia rarely
sails in squadrons, but wanders solitary and self-dependent
over the tropical seas, a terror even to
man, by the power which it possesses of stinging
and inflicting pain upon whatever comes in contact
with its long, trailing cables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is another little sailor called the <span class='it'>velella</span>;
unprovided with offensive weapons, though formed
in most respects upon a model somewhat similar to
that of the physalia, unguarded as the peaceful trader
against the piratical attacks of a thousand enemies,
its very race would soon become extinct, were it
not for its unlimited increase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Provided with a flat, transparent, oval scale of cartilage,
for the support of a gelatinous body, it floats
by specific levity, alone, for it has no air vessel—and
employs its hundreds of stomachs for ballast.
Another scale arising at right angles with the first
and covered with thin membrane, supplies it with a
sail. This unprotected creature serves as food for
many predatory tribes, and of these, the most voracious
is the barnacle. The flesh devoured, the scales
still float for many days, mere wrecks of these gay
vessels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The velellæ are usually found in fleets, and to
convey some idea of their numbers, I may state that
on one occasion, when sailing before the western
winds, beyond the southern latitude of the Cape of
Good Hope, our ship encountered a group of globular
masses of a pale yellow color swimming upon
the surface and surrounded by fringes of an unknown
substance. Each mass resembled the eggs of some
great sea-bird, reposing on a nest of buoyant feathers.
Taking them with a dip net, from the chains, we
found the yellow masses to be globular cryptogamous
plants, to every one of which adhered a group
of barnacles, far larger than the largest I had ever
seen before.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Many of these last were so intent
upon demolishing their prey, that, even in leaving
their native element, to fall into the hands of tyrants
more dangerous than themselves, it was not always
relinquished. Grasping in their horny arms the unfortunate
velellæ, they continued grinding the soft
jelly from the tougher cartilage, with an avidity and
determination that reminded me strongly of the scene

<p class='pindent'>This drew our attention to the source from which
such plentiful supplies of food were obtained, and on
examination, the ocean was found literally covered
with the scales of the murdered velellæ, faintly distinguishable
by their glistening in the sunshine, and
interspersed with a few living specimens waiting
their turn in the general massacre. We scooped
them up by thousands; and for three long days the
ship swept onward “dead before the wind” with
the steady and scarcely paralleled speed of more than
ten knots an hour, thus accomplishing a change of
more than seven hundred miles in longitude, before
the last remnant of this unhappy fleet was passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though it is not pretended that these little sea-boats
possess the phosphorescent quality, their numbers
and the wide extent of their flotilla will suffice
to render far less wonderful the vastness of those
beautiful results of animal secretion which have
furnished the subject of this sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there are other similar and more remarkable
phenomena attendant on these brilliant night scenes,
that can only be explained, either by supposing that
myriads of these aquatic beings are endowed with a
community of instinct, or, that the changes of the
weather influenced them in such a way as to awaken
all their luminous powers upon the instant, without
the intervention of any mechanical disturbing cause,
in the mere frolic mood of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those who have visited the Chinese islands, or
either of several other well known regions in the
Pacific, have been occasionally surprised, on a calm
moon-light night, when scarce a swell, and not a
ripple is perceptible, to see the ocean suddenly converted
into one wide pool of milk! As described by
a few observers who have been so fortunate as
to witness this rare and strange appearance, the
color is so equally diffused over the whole field of
view, that all resemblance to the ordinary hue is
lost, and yet no wandering stars,—no scattered
torches can be seen—not even beneath the bows—so
feeble is the intensity of the light emitted, that
several have denied the agency of phosphorescence
in producing this remarkable effect, and were convinced
there was a real change in the nature of the
fluid; but others, less enamored of the supernatural,
have clearly proved that even this phenomenon is
due to the activity of an infinity of animalcules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very rarity of such occurrences distinctly
shows that the microscopic beings which produce it
do not emit their light at all times, and there must
exist some cause for this wide-spread and consentaneous
action. To community of instinct it can hardly
be attributed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may understand the fact, wonderful as it may
be, that an army of emmets should cross a public
road or open space, from field to field, or from forest
to forest, fashioning themselves, as they are sometimes
known to do, into the form of a snake, by
crawling over each other’s backs, by dozens, from
the tail to the head of the figure; thus shortening it
at one extremity, while they lengthen it at the other,
and cause it to advance slowly towards their desired
retreat! We may understand this evidence of untaught
wisdom, for we see its purpose and its usefulness.
Such means enable these defenceless beings
to elude the vigilance of their feathery enemies,
whose beaks, but for the terror of the mimic reptile,
would soon annihilate the weak community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We may even comprehend that more magnificent
display of providential guidance witnessed in the
habits of the coral animals, where nations of separate
beings, outnumbering a thousand times the
living population of the earth and air, enjoy one
common life, and build up islands, for the use of man,
on models definitely fixed. For here, also, there is
<span class='it'>purpose</span>, and were it not that every individual of the
host performs his proper duty—constructing, <span class='it'>here</span> a
buttress, <span class='it'>there</span> an alcove,—the dash of the billows
and the fury of the storm would soon disintegrate
the growing structure. The reef that lies athwart
the mariner’s path, and strews itself with wrecks,
would never rise above the surface, to gather the
seeds of vegetation, attract the cool, fresh moisture
from the air, and lay foundations for the future happiness
and wealth of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But how shall we explain an instinct by which
myriads of creatures, totally distinct and unconnected,
are induced, without apparent end or object,
to act in concert over leagues of sea, as it would
seem merely to fright the passing voyager! It may
be that the action of these animalcules, by which
the milky glimmering is occasioned, is involuntary.
It may be the result of atmospheric or electric influence
upon the living frame, to serve some hidden
purpose in their unknown economy; for many things,
even in our own organic history, surpass our powers
of comprehension; we know neither their nature nor
their use. But analogy would lead us to infer the
exercise of <span class='it'>will</span> in all the various phenomena of
phosphorescence, however impenetrable the purpose
of its exercise may be. Like the insect songs of a
summer night, or the love-light of the glow-worm
and the fire-fly, they probably control or guide the
motions of the individual or of whole communities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This idea receives some countenance from the history
of a more remarkable example of this sub-marine
meteor, witnessed in the southern summer
of 1823-4, near the island of Tristan d’Acunha,
under circumstances never to be forgotten—and with
one short notice of its character I will leave the
reader to his reflections upon these wonders of the
deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was dark and damp—the western breeze
too light to steady the vessel, and she rolled heavily
over the wide swell of the South Atlantic, making it
difficult for a landsman to maintain his footing on the
deck. A fog-bank, which hung around the northern
horizon at sunset, now came sweeping slowly down
upon us in the twilight. The captain ordered the
light sails furled in expectation of a squall, and we
stood leaning together over the bulwarks, watching
the mist, which approached more and more rapidly,
till it resembled, in the increasing darkness, an immense
and toppling wall extending from the water
to the clouds, and seemed threatening to crush us
beneath it. There was something peculiarly awful
in its impenetrable obscurity; and even the crew
relinquished their several occupations to gaze on the
unusual aspect of the fog. It reached us;—but just
at this moment, a flash, like a broad sheet of summer
lightning, spread itself over the ocean as far as the
eye could reach, but deep below the waves. Five
or six times, at intervals, of a few seconds, the flash
was repeated, and then the vessel was enveloped in
the mist. The breeze immediately quickened; the
sailors sprang to their stations, and, for a few minutes,
the bustle of preparation for a change of wind attracted
the exclusive attention of every one. In this
short interval, the narrow belt of vapor had passed
off to leeward, and left us bounding merrily along at
the rate of ten knots an hour, with a spanking
norther full upon our beam, over waves sparkling
and dancing in the clear, bright moon-light. But, <span class='it'>the
lightning of the waters was gone</span>!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In one of those sweet glens, half pastoral half sylvan,
which may be found in hundreds channelling
the steep sides of the moorland hills, and sending
down the tribute of their pure limestone springs to
the broad rapid rivers which fertilize no less than
they adorn the lovely vales of Western Yorkshire,
there may be seen to this day the ruins of an old
dwelling-house, situate on a spot so picturesque, so
wild, and yet so soft in its romantic features, that they
would well repay the traveller for a brief halt, who,
but too often, hurries onward in search of more remote
yet certainly not greater beauties. The gorge,
within the mouth of which the venerable pile is
seated, opens into the broader valley from the north-eastern
side, enjoying the full light and warmth of the
southern sunshine; and, although very narrow at its
origin, where its small crystal rivulet springs up
from the lonely well-head, fringed by a few low
shrubs of birch and alder, expands here, at its mouth,
into a pretty amphitheatre or basin of a few acres
circuit. A wild and feathery coppice of oak, and
birch, and hazel, with here and there a mountain
ash, showing its bright red berries through the rich
foliage, clothes all the lower part of the surrounding
slopes; while, far above, the seamed and shattered
faces of the gray, slaty limestone rise up like artificial
walls, their summits crowned with the fair purple
heather, and every nook and cranny in their sides
crowded with odorous wild flowers. Within the circuit
of these natural limits, sheltering it from every
wind of heaven, except the gentle south, the turf lies
smooth and even as if it were a cultured lawn; while
a few rare exotic shrubs, now all run out of shape,
and bare, and straggling, indicate even yet the time
when it was a fair shrubbery, tended by gentle hands,
and visited by young and lovely beings, now cold in
their untimely sepulchres. The streamlet, which
comes gushing down the glen with its clear, copious
flow, boiling and murmuring about the large gray
boulders which everywhere obstruct its channels,
making a thousand mimic cataracts, and wakening
ever a wild, mirthful music, sweeps here quite close
to the foot of the eastern cliff, the feathery branches
of the oakwood dipping their foliage in its eddies, and
then, just as it issues forth into the open champaine,
wheels round in a half circle, completely fanning
the little amphitheatre above, except at one point
hard beneath the opposite hill face, where a small
winding horse track, engrossing the whole space between
the streamlet and the limestone rock, gives
access to the lone demesne. A small green hillock,
sloping down gently to the southward, fills the embracing
arms of the bright brook, around the northern
base of which is scattered a little grove of the most
magnificent and noblest sycamores that I have ever
seen; but on the other side, which yet retains its
pristine character of a smooth open lawn, there are
no obstacles to the view over the wide valley, except
three old gnarled thorn bushes, uncommon from their
size and the dense luxuriance of their matted greenery.
It was upon the summit of this little knoll that the old
homestead stood, whose massive ruins of red freestone,
all overgrown with briers, and tall rank grass
and dock leaves, deface the spot which they adorned
of old; and, when it was erect in all its fair proportions,
the scene which it overlooked, and its own
natural attractions, rendered it one of the loveliest
residences in all the north of England—the wide,
rich, gentle valley, all meadow land or pasture, without
one brown ploughed field to mar its velvet green;
the tall, thick hawthorn hedges, with their long lines
of hedgerow timber, oak, ash and elm, waving above
the smooth enclosures; the broad, clear, tranquil river
flashing out like a silver mirror through the green
foliage; the scattered farm-houses, each nestled as it
were among its sheltering orchards; the village spire
shooting up from the clump of giant elms which over-shadow
the old grave-yard; the steep, long slope on
the other side of the vale, or strath, as it would be
called in Scotland, all mapped out to the eye, with
its green fences and wide hanging woods; and, far
beyond, the rounded summits of the huge moorland
hills, ridge above ridge, purple, and grand, and massive,
but less and less distinct as they recede from the
eye, and melt away at last into the far blue distance—such
was the picture which its windows overlooked
of old, and which still laughs as gaily in the sunshine
around its mouldering walls and lonely hearth-stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if it is fair now, and lovely, what was it as it
showed in the good old days of King Charles, before
the iron hand of civil war had pressed so heavily on
England? The grove of sycamores stood there, as
they stand now, in the prime and luxuriance of their
sylvan manhood; for they are waxing now aged and
somewhat gray and stag-horned; and the thorn
bushes sheltered, as they do now, whole choirs of
thrushes and blackbirds, but all the turf beneath the
scattered trees and on the sunny slope was shorn,
and rolled, and watered, that it was smooth and
even, and far softer than the most costly carpet that
ever wooed the step of Persian beauty. The Hall
was a square building, not very large, of the old
Elizabethan style, with two irregular additions,
wings, as they might be called, of the same architecture,
though of a later period, and its deep-embayed
oriel windows, with their fantastic mullions of carved
freestone, its tall quaint chimneys, and its low porch,
with overhanging canopy and clustered columns,
rendered it an object singularly picturesque and
striking. The little green within the gorge of the
upper glen, which is so wildly beautiful in its present
situation, left as it is to the unaided hand of nature,
was then a perfect paradise; for an exquisite taste
had superintended its conversion into a sort of untrained
garden; an eye well used to note effects had
marked its natural capabilities, and, adding artificial
beauties, had never trenched upon the character of
the spot by anything incongruous or startling. Rare
plants, rich-flowering shrubs, and scented herbs were
indeed scattered with a lavish hand about its precincts,
but were so scattered that they seemed the
genuine productions of the soil; the Spanish cistus
had been taught to carpet the wild crags in conjunction
with the native thyme and heather; the arbutus
and laurestinus had been brought from afar to vie
with the mountain ash and holly; the clematis and
the sweet scented vine blended their tendrils with the
rich English honeysuckle and the luxuriant ivy; rare
lotuses might be seen floating with their azure
colored cups and broad green leaves upon the glassy
basins, into which the mountain streamlet had been
taught to expand, among the white wild water lilies
and the bright yellow clusters of the marsh marigold;
roses of every hue and scent, from the dark crimson
of Damascus to the pale blush of soft Provence, grew
side by side with the wild wood-brier and the eglantine,
and many a rustic seat, of mossy stone or roots
and unbarked branches, invited the loitering visiter
in every shadowy angle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no spot in all the north of England
whereon the winter frowned so lightly as on those
sheltered precincts—there was no spot whereon
spring smiled so early, and with so bright an aspect—wherein
the summer so long lingered, pouring her
gorgeous flowers, rich with her spicy breath, into the
very lap of autumn. It was, indeed, a sweet spot,
and as happy as it was sweet and beautiful, before
the curse of civil war was poured upon the groaning
land, with its dread train of foul and fiendish ministers;
and yet it was not war, nor any of its direct
consequences, that turned that happy home into a
ruin and a desolation. It was not war—except the
struggles of the human heart—the conflict of the
fierce and turbulent passions—the strife of principles,
of motives, of desires, within the secret soul, maybe
called war, as, indeed, they might, and that with no
figurative tongue, for they are surely the hottest, the
most devastating, the most fatal of all that bear that
ominous and cruel appellation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the aspect then of Ingleborough Hall, at
the period when it was perhaps the most beautiful;
and when, as is but too often the case, its beauties
were on the very point of being brought to a close
forever. The family which owned the manor, for the
possessions attached to the old homestead were large,
and the authority attached to them extended over a
large part of Upper Wharfdale, was one of those old
English races which, though not noble in the literal
sense of the word, are yet so ancient, and so indissolubly
connected with the soil, that they may justly
be comprised among the aristocracy of the land. The
name was Saxon, and it was generally believed—and
probably with truth—that the date of the name, and of
its connection with that estate, was at the least coeval
with the conquest. To what circumstances it was
owing that the Hawkwoods, for such was the time-honored
appellation of the race, had retained possession
of their fair demesne when all the land was
allotted out to feudal barons and fat priests, can never
now be ascertained; nor does it indeed signify; yet
that it was to some honorable cause, some service
rendered, or some high exploit, may be fairly presumed
from the fact that the mitred potentate of
Bolton Abbey, who levied his tythes far and near
throughout those fertile valleys, had no claims on the
fruits of Ingleborough. During the ages that had
passed since the advent of the Norman William, the
Hawkwoods had never lacked male representatives
to sustain the dignity of their race; and gallantly had
they sustained it; for in full many a lay and legend,
aye! and in grave, cold history itself, the name of
Hawkwood might be found side by side with the
more sonorous appellations of the Norman feudatories,
the Ardens, and Maulevers, and Vavasours,
which fill the chronicles of border warfare. At the
period of which we write, however, the family had
no male scion—the last male heir, Ralph Hawkwood,
had died some years before, full of years and of domestic
honors—a zealous sportsman, a loyal subject,
a kind landlord, a good friend—his lot had fallen in
quiet times and pleasant places, and he lived happily,
and died in the arms of his family, at peace with all
men. His wife, a calm and placid dame, who had,
in her young days, been the beauty of the shire, survived
him, and spent her whole time, as she devoted
her whole mind and spirit, in educating the two
daughters, joint heiresses of the old manor-houses,
who were left by their father’s death, two bright-eyed
fair-haired prattlers, dependent for protection on the
strong love but frail support of their widowed mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years passed away, and with their flight the two
fair children were matured into two sweet and lovely
women; yet the same fleeting suns which brought to
them complete and perfect youth were fraught to
others with decay, and all the carking cares, and
querulous ailments of old age. The mother, who had
watched with keen solicitude over their budding infancy,
over the promise of their lovely childhood,
lived indeed, but lived not to see or understand the
full accomplishment of that bright promise. Even
before the elder girl had reached the dawn of womanhood,
palsy had shaken the enfeebled limbs, and its
accustomed follower—mental debility—had, in no
small degree, impaired the intellect of her surviving
parent; but long before her sister had reached her
own maturity, the limbs were helplessly immovable,
the mind was wholly clouded and estranged. It was
not now the wandering and uncertain darkness that
flits across the veiled horizon of the mind alternately
with vivid gleams, flashes of memory and intellect,
brighter perhaps than ever visited the spirit until its
partial aberrations had jarred its vital principle—it
was that deep and utter torpor, blanker than sleep
and duller, for no dreams seem to mingle with its
day-long lethargy—that absolute paralysis of all the
faculties of soul and body, which is so beautifully
painted by the great Roman satirist, as the</p>

or by the sparkling hearth of winter. Such
was the mother now; so utterly, so hopelessly dependent
on the cares and gratitude of those bright
beings whose infancy she had nursed so devotedly—and
well was that devotedness now compensated;
for day and night, winter and summer, did those
sweet girls by turn watch over the frail, querulous
sexagenarian—never both leaving her at once, one
sleeping while the other watched, attentive ever to
her importunate and ceaseless cravings, patient and
mild to meet her angry and uncalled for lamentations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You would have thought that a seclusion so entire,
from all society of their equals, must have prevented
their acquiring those usual accomplishments, those
necessary arts, which every English gentlewoman
is presumed to possess as things of course—that they
must have grown up mere ignorant, unpolished
country lasses, without a taste or aspiration beyond
the small routine of their dull daily duties—that long
confinement must have broken the higher and more
spiritual parts of their fine natural minds—that they
must have become mere moping household drudges—and
so to think would be so very natural, that it is
by no means easy to conceive how it was brought to
pass, that the very opposite of this should have been
the result. The very opposite it was, however—for
as there were not in the whole West Riding two
girls more beautiful than Annabel and Marian Hawkwood,
so were there surely none so highly educated,
so happy in themselves, so eminently calculated to
render others happy. Accomplished as musicians
both, though Annabel especially excelled in instrumental
music, while her young sister was unrivalled
in voice and execution as a songstress; both skilled
in painting; and if not poetesses in so much as to be
stringers of words and rhymes, certainly such, and
that too of no mean order, in the wider and far higher
acceptation of the word; for their whole souls were
attuned to the very highest key of spiritual sensibility—romantic,
not in the weak and ordinary meaning of
the term, but as admirers of all things high, and pure,
and noble—worshippers of the beautiful, whether it
were embodied in the wild scenery of their native
glens, in the rock, the stream, the forest, the sunshine
that clothed all of them in a rich garb of glory,
or the dread storm that veiled them all in gloom and
terror—or in the master-pieces of the schools of painting
and of sculpture—or in the pages of the great,
the glorious of all ages—or in the deeds of men,
perils encountered hardily, sufferings constantly endured,
sorrows assuaged by charitable generosity.
Such were they in the strain and tenor of their minds;
gentle, moreover, as the gentlest of created things;
humble to their inferiors, but with a proud, and self-respecting,
and considerate humility; open, and free,
and frank toward their equals; but proud, although
not wanting in loyalty and proper reverence for the
great, and almost haughty of demeanor to their superiors,
when they encountered any such, which was,
indeed, of rare and singular occurrence. It was a
strange thing, indeed, that these lone girls should
have possessed such characters, so strongly marked,
so powerful and striking; should have acquired accomplishments,
so many and so various in their nature.
It will appear, perhaps, even stranger to
merely superficial thinkers, that the formation of
those powerful characters had been, for the most part,
brought about by the very circumstances which would
at first have appeared most unpropitious—their solitary
habits namely, and their seclusion, almost absolute
seclusion, from the gay world of fashion and of
folly. The large and opulent county, in which their
patrimony lay, was indeed then, as now, studded
with the estates, the manors, and the parks of the
richest and the noblest of England’s aristocracy, yet
the deep glens and lofty moorlands among which
Ingleborough Hall was situate, are even to this day a
lonely and sequestered region; no great post-road
winds through their devious passes; and, although in
the close vicinity of large and populous towns, they
are, even in the nineteenth century, but little visited,
and are occupied by a population singularly primitive
and pastoral in all its thoughts and feelings. Much
more then in those days, when carriages were seen
but rarely beyond the streets of the metropolis, when
roads were wild and rugged, and intercourse between
the nearest places, unless of more than ordinary magnitude,
difficult and uncertain, was that wild district
to be deemed secluded. So much so, indeed, was
this the case, at the time of which I write, that there
were not within a circle of some twenty miles two
families of equal rank, or filling the same station in
society, with the Hawkwoods. This, had the family
been in such circumstances of domestic health and
happiness as would have permitted the girls to mingle
in the gaieties of the neighborhood, would have been
a serious and severe misfortune; as they must, from
continual intercourse with their inferiors, have contracted,
in a greater or less degree, a grossness both
of mind and manners; and would, most probably,
have fallen into that most destructive habit—destructive
to the mind, I mean, and to all chance of progress
or advancement—the love of queening it in
low society. It was, therefore, under their circumstances,
including the loss of one parent and the entire
bereavement of the other, fortunate in no small
degree that they were compelled to seek their pleasures
and their occupations, no less than their duties,
within the sphere of the domestic circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother, who was now so feeble and so helpless,
though never a person of much intellectual
energy, or indeed of much force of any kind, was
yet in the highest sense of the word a lady; she had
seen in her youth something of the great world, apart
from the rural glens which witnessed her decline;
had mingled with the gay and noble even at the court
of England, and, being possessed of more than ordinary
beauty, had been a favorite and in some degree
a belle. From her, then, had her daughters naturally
and unconsciously imbibed that easy, graceful finish
which, more than all beside, is the true stamp of
gentle birth and bearing. Long before children can
be brought to comprehend general principles or rules
of convention, they can and do acquire habits, by
that strange tact of imitation and observance which
certainly commences at a stage so early of their
young, frail existences, that we cannot, by any effort,
mark its first dawning—habits which, thus acquired,
can hardly be effaced at all—which will endure unaltered
and invariable when tastes, and practices,
and modes of thought and action, contracted long,
long afterward, have faded quite away and been forgotten.
Thus was it, then, with these young creatures;
while they were yet mere girls, with all the
pure, right impulses of childhood bursting out fresh
and fair, they had been trained up in the midst of
high, and honorable, and correct associations—naught
low, or mean, or little; naught selfish, or dishonest,
or corrupt had ever come near to them—in
the sight of virtue and in the practice of politeness
they had shot up into maturity; and their maturity,
of consequence, was virtuous and polished. In after
years, devoted as they were to that sick mother, they
had no chance of unlearning anything; and thus,
from day to day, they went on gaining fresh graces,
as it were, by deduction from their foregone teachings,
and from the purity of their young natures—for
purity and nature, when united, must of necessity
be graceful—until the proudest courts of Europe
could have shown nothing, even in their most difficult
circles, that could surpass, even it could vie
with, the easy, artless frankness, the soft and finished
courtesy, the unabashed yet modest grace of those
two mountain maidens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the period when my sad tale commences—for it
is no less sad than true—the sisters had just reached
the young yet perfect bloom of mature womanhood,
the elder, Annabel, having attained her twentieth
summer, her sister Marian being exactly one year
younger; and certainly two sweeter or more lovely
girls could not be pictured or imagined—not in the
brightest moments of the painter’s or the poet’s inspiration.
They were both tall and beautifully
formed—both had sweet low-toned voices—that excellent
thing in woman!—but here all personal resemblance
ended; for Annabel, the elder, had a complexion
pure and transparent as the snow of the untrodden
glacier before the sun has kissed it into
roseate blushes, and quite as colorless; her features
were of the finest classic outline; the smooth, fair
brow, the perfect Grecian nose, the short curve of
the upper lip, the exquisite arch of the small mouth,
the chiselled lines of the soft rounded chin, might
have served for a model to a sculptor, whereby to
mould a mountain nymph or Naiad; her rich luxuriant
hair was of a light and sunny brown, her eyes
of a clear, lustrous blue, with a soft, languid, and
half melancholy tenderness for their more usual expression,
which united well with the calm, placid air
which was almost habitual to her beautiful features.
To this no contrast more complete could have been
offered than by the widely different style of Marian’s
loveliness. Though younger than her sister, her
figure was more full and rounded—so much so, that
it reached the very point where symmetry is combined
with voluptuousness—yet was there nothing in
the least degree voluptuous in the expression of her
bright artless face. Her forehead, higher than Annabel’s,
and broader, was as smooth and as white as
polished marble; her brows were well-defined and
black as ebony, as were the long, long lashes that
fringed her laughing eyes—eyes of the brightest,
lightest azure that ever glanced with merriment, or
melted into love—her nose was small and delicate,
but turned a little upwards, so as to add, however,
rather than detract from the <span class='it'>tout ensemble</span> of her
arch, roguish beauty—her mouth was not very
small, but exquisitely formed, with lips redder than
anything in nature, to which lips can be well compared,
and filled with teeth, regular, white and beautifully
even—fair as her sister’s, and, like hers, showing
every where the tiny veins of azure meandering
below the milky skin, Marian’s complexion was yet
as bright as morning—faint rosy tints and red, warm
blushes succeeding one another, or vanishing away
and leaving the cheek pearly white, as one emotion
followed and effaced another in her pure, innocent
mind. Her hair, profuse in its luxuriant flow, was of
a deep dark brown, that might have been almost
called black, but for a thousand glancing golden
lights and warm rich shadows that varied its smooth
surface with the varying sunshine, and was worn in
a thick, massive plait low down in the neck behind,
while on either side the brow it was trained off and
taught to cluster in front of either tiny ear in an
abundant maze of interwoven curls, close and mysteriously
enlaced as are the tendrils of the wild vine,
which, fluttering on each warm and blushing cheek,
fell down the swan-like neck in heavy natural ringlets.
But to describe her features is to give no idea,
in the least, of Marian’s real beauty—there was a
radiant, dazzling lustre that leaped out of her every
feature, lightning from her quick, speaking eyes, and
playing in the dimples of her bewitching smile, that
so intoxicated the beholder that he would dwell upon
her face entranced, and know that it was lovely, and
feel that it was far more lovely, far more enthralling
than any he had ever looked upon before; yet, when
without the sphere of that enchantment, he should be
all unable to say wherein consisted its unmatched
attraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the natural disposition and temperaments
of the two sisters there was perhaps even a wider
difference than between the characteristics of their
personal beauty; for Annabel was calm, and mild,
and singularly placid, not in her manners only, but in
the whole tenor of her thoughts, and words, and
actions; there was a sort of gentle melancholy, that
was not altogether melancholy either, pervading her
every tone of voice, her every change of feature.
She was not exactly grave, nor pensive, nor subdued,
for she could smile very joyously at times, could act
upon emergencies with readiness, and quickness,
and decision, and was at all times prompt in the expression
of her confirmed sentiments; but there was
a very remarkable tranquillity in her mode of doing
every thing she did, betokening fully the presence of
a decided principle directing her at every step, so
that she was but rarely agitated, even by accidents
of the most sudden and alarming character, and never
actuated by any rapid impulse. The very opposite
of this was Marian Hawkwood; for, although quite
as upright and pure minded as her sister, and, what is
more, of a temper quite as amiable and sweet, yet
was her mood as changeful as an April day; although
it was more used to mirth and joyous laughter than
to frowns or tears either, yet had she tears as ready
at any tale of sorrow as are the fountains of the
spring shower in the cloud, and eloquent frowns and
eyes that lightened their quick indignation at any
outrage, or oppression, or high-handed violence; her
cheek would crimson with the tell-tale blood, her
flesh would seem to thrill upon her bones, her voice
would choke, and her eyes swim with sympathetic
drops whenever she read, or spoke, or heard of any
noble deed, whether of gallant daring, or of heroic
self-denial. Her tongue was prompt always, as the
sword of the knight errant, to shelter the defenceless,
to shield the innocent, to right the wronged, and
sometimes to avenge the absent. Artless herself,
and innocent in every thought and feeling, she set no
guard on either; but as she felt and thought so she
spoke out and acted, fearless even as she was unconscious
of any wrong, defying misconstruction, and
half inclined to doubt the possibility of evil in the
minds of others, so foreign did it seem, and so impossible
to her own natural and, as it were, instinctive
sense of right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet although such in all respects as I have striven
to depict them, the one all quick and flashing impulse,
the other all reflective and considerate principle, it
was most wonderful how seldom there was any
clashing of opinion and diversity of judgment as to
what was to be done, what left undone, between the
lovely sisters. Marian would, it is true, often jump
at once to conclusions, and act as rapidly upon them,
at which the more reflective Annabel would arrive
only after some consideration—but it did not occur
more often that the one had reason to repent of her
precipitation than the other of her over caution—neither,
indeed, had much cause for remorse of this
kind at all, for all the impulses of the one, all the
thoughts and principles of the other, were alike pure
and kindly. With words, however, it was not quite
so; for it must be admitted that Marian oftentimes
said things, how unfrequently soever she did aught,
which she would willingly have recalled afterwards;
not, indeed, that she ever said anything unkind or
wrong in itself, and rarely anything that could give
pain to another, unless that pain were richly merited
indeed—but that she gradually came to learn, long
before she learned to restrain her impulses, that it
may be very often unwise to speak what in itself is
wise—and very often, if not wrong, yet certainly
imprudent and of evil consequences to give loud
utterance even to right opinions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the persons, such the dispositions of the
fair heiresses of Ingleborough, at the time when
they had attained the ages I have specified, and certainly,
although their sphere of usefulness would
have appeared at first sight circumscribed, and the
range of their enjoyments very narrow, there rarely
have been seen two happier or more useful beings
than Annabel and Marian Hawkwood, in this wide
world of sin and sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The care of their bereaved and hapless parent
occupied, it is true, the greater portion of their time,
yet they found many leisure hours to devote to visiting
the poor, aiding the wants of the needy, consoling
the sorrows of those who mourned, and sympathizing
with the pleasures of the happy among their humble
neighbors. To them this might be truly termed a
work of love and pleasure, for it is questionable
whether from any other source the lovely girls derived
a higher or more satisfactory enjoyment, than
from their tours of charity among their village pensioners.
Next in the scale of happiness stood,
doubtless, the society of the old vicar of that pastoral
parish, a man who had been their father’s friend and
counsellor in those young days of college friendship,
when the fresh heart is uppermost in all, and selfishness
a dormant passion; a man old enough almost to
have been their grandsire, but with a heart as young
and cheery as a boy’s—an intellect accomplished in
the deepest lore of the schools, both classical and
scientific, and skilled thoroughly in all the niceties
and graces of French, and Spanish, and Italian literature.
A man who had known courts, and camps
too, for a short space in his youth; who had seen
much, and suffered much, and yet enjoyed not a little,
in his acquaintance with the world; and who, from
sights, and sufferings, and enjoyments, had learned
that if there is much evil, there is yet more of good
even in <span class='it'>this</span> world—had learned, while rigid to his
own, to be most lenient to his neighbor’s failings—had
learned that charity should be the fruit of wisdom!—and
had learned all this only to practise it in
all his daily walks, to inculcate it in all his weekly
lessons. This aged man, and his scarce less aged
wife, living scarcely a stone’s throw from the Hall,
had grown almost to think themselves a portion of
the family; and surely no blood kindred could have
created stronger ties of kindness than had the
familiarity of long acquaintance, the confidence of
old hereditary love. Lower yet in the round of their
enjoyments, but still a constant source of blameless
satisfaction, were their books, their music, their
drawings, the management of their household, the
cultivation of their lovely garden, the ministering to
the wants of their loved birds and flowers. Thus, all
sequestered and secluded from the world, placed in
the midst of onerous duties and solicitudes almost innumerable,
though they had never danced at a ball,
nor blushed at the praises of their own beauty flowing
from eloquent lips, nor listened to a lover’s suit,
queens might have envied the felicity, the calm, pure,
peaceful happiness of Annabel and Marian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were, indeed, <span class='it'>too</span> happy! I do not mean too
happy to be virtuous, too happy to be mindful of, and
grateful to, the Giver of all joy—but, as the common
phrase runs, too happy for their happiness to be enduring.
That is a strange belief—a wondrous superstition!—and
yet it has been common to all ages.
The Greeks, those wild poetic dreamers, imagined
that their vain gods, made up of mortal attributes,
<span class='it'>envied</span> the bliss of men, fearing that wretched earthlings
should vie in happiness with the possessors of
Olympus. They sang in their dark mystic choruses,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“That perfect bliss of men not childless dies,</p>

<p class='line0'>Of woes, that spring from fairest fortune blind⁠—”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>and, though their other doctrines of that insuperable
destiny, that absolute necessity, to resist which is
needless labor; and of ancestral guilt, still reproducing
guilt through countless generations, would
seem to militate against it, there was no more established
faith, and no more prevalent opinion, than
that unwonted fortunes were necessarily followed by
most unusual wo—hence, perhaps, the stern self-mortification
of the middle ages—hence, certainly,
the vulgar terror, prevalent more or less among all
classes, and in every time and country, that children
are too beautiful, too prematurely wise, too good, to
be long-lived—that happiness is too great to be lasting—that
mornings are too fine to augur stormless
days! And we—aye! we ourselves—we of a better
and purer dispensation—we half believe all this, and
more than half tremble at it, although in truth there
is no cause for fear in the belief—since, if there be
aught of truth in the mysterious creed, which facts
do in a certain sense seem to bear out, we can but
think, we cannot but perceive, that this is but a varied
form of care and mercy vouchsafed by the Great
All-perfect, towards his frail creatures—that this is
but a merciful provision to hinder us from laying up
for ourselves “treasures upon earth, where moth and
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through
and steal”—a provision to restrain us from forgetting,
in the small temporary bliss of the present, the boundless
and incomparable beatitude of the future—to
warn us against bartering, like Esau, our birthright
for a mess of pottage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I am not now called to follow out this train of
thought, suggested by the change in the fortunes of
those to whom I am performing the part of historian—by
the change I say in their fortunes—a change
arising, too, from the very circumstances, as is so
frequently the case, which seemed to promise the
most fairly for their improvement and their permanence—oh,
how blind guides are we—even the most
far-sighted of us all—how weak and senseless judges,
even the most sagacious—how false and erring
prophets, even the wisest and the best!⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I must not anticipate, nor overrun my scent,
meriting, like a babbling hound, the harsh thong of
the huntsman critic. It was, as I have said already,
somewhere in the summer wherefrom Annabel reckoned
her twentieth, and Marian her nineteenth year—very
late in the last month of summer, an hour or
two before the sunset of as beautiful an evening as
ever smiled upon the face of the green earth; the
sky was nearly cloudless, though a thin gauze-like
haze had floated up from the horizon, and so far
veiled the orb of the great sun, that the eye could
gaze undazzled on his glories; and the whole air
was full of a rich golden light which flooded all the
level meadows with its lustre,—except where they
were checkered by the long cool blue shadows, projected
from the massive clumps of noble forest trees,
which singly or in groups diversified the lovely vale—and
gilded the tall slender steeple of the old village
church, and glanced in living fire from the broad oriel
windows of the Hall. Such was the evening, and so
beautiful the prospect, with every sound and sight in
perfect harmony—the sharp squeak of the rapid
swifts wheeling their airy circles around the distant
spire, the full and liquid melodies of thrush and
blackbird from out the thorn bushes upon the lawn,
the lowing of the cows returning from their pasture
to pay the evening tribute, the very cawing of the
homeward rooks blended by distance into a continuous
and soothing murmur, the rippling music of the
stream, the low sigh of the west wind in the foliage
of the sycamores, the far shout of the children happy
at their release from school, the carol of a solitary
milkmaid, combining to make up music as sweet as
can be heard or dreamed of. That lovely picture
was surveyed, and that delicious melody was listened
to by eyes and ears well fitted to appreciate their
loveliness—for at an open casement of a neat parlor in
the Hall, with furniture all covered with those elegant
appliances of female industry—well-filled drawings,
and books, and instruments of music, and work
baskets, and frames for embroidery—which show so
pleasantly that the apartment is one, not of show, but
of calm home enjoyment, sat Annabel, alone—for
the presence of the frail paralytic being, who dozed
in her arm-chair at the farther end of the room, cannot
be held to constitute society. Marian, for the first
time in her life, was absent from her home on a visit,
which had already endured nearly six weeks, to the
only near relative of the family who was yet living—a
younger sister of her mother—who had married
many years ago a clergyman, whose piety and talents
had raised him to a stall in the cathedral church of
York, where he resided with his wife—a childless
couple. This worthy pair had passed a portion of
the summer at the Hall, and, when returning to the
metropolis of the county, had prevailed on their
younger niece, not altogether without difficulty, to go
with them for a few weeks, and see a little of society
on a scale something more extended than that which
her native vales could offer. It was the first time in
their lives that the sisters ever had been parted for
more than a few days, and now the hours were beginning
to appear very long to Annabel, as weeks
were running into months, and the gorgeous suns of
summer were fast preparing to give place to the cold
dews and frosty winds of autumn. The evening
meal was over, and a solitary thing was that meal
now, which used to be the most delightful of the day,
and hastily did the lonely sister hurry it over, thinking
all the while what might be Marian’s occupation
at the moment, and whether she too was engaged in
thoughts concerning her far friends and the fair home
of her childhood. It was then in a mood half melancholy,
and half listless, that Annabel was gazing
from her window down the broad valley to the eastward,
marvelling at the beauty of the scenery, though
she had noted every changing hue that flitted over
the far purple hills a thousand times before; and
listening to every sweet familiar sound, and yet at
the same time pondering, as if she were quite unconscious
of all that met her senses, about things which,
she fancied, might be happening at York, when on a
sudden her attention was aroused by a dense cloud
of dust rising beyond the river, upon the line of the
highroad, and sweeping up the valley with a progress
so unusually rapid as indicated that the objects,
which it veiled from view, must be in more than
commonly quick motion. For a few moments she
watched this little marvel narrowly, but without any
apprehension or even any solicitude, until, as it drew
nearer, she could perceive at times bright flashes as
if of polished metal gleaming out through the murky
wreaths, and feathers waving in the air. The year
was that in which the hapless Charles, all hopes of
reconciliation with the parliament being decidedly
frustrated, displayed the banner of civil war, and
drew the sword against his subjects. The rumors of
the coming strife had circulated, like the dread sub-terraneous
rumblings which harbinger the earth-quake,
through all the country far and near, sad
omens of approaching evil; and more distinctly were
they bruited throughout Yorkshire, in consequence of
the attempt which had been made by the royal party
to secure Hull with all its magazines and shipping—frustrated
by the energy and spirit of the Hothams—so
that, as soon as she perceived that the dust was,
beyond all doubt, stirred up by a small party of well
appointed horse, Annabel entertained no doubts as
to the meaning, but many serious apprehensions as
to the cause, of the present visitation. The road by
which the cavaliers were proceeding, though well
made and passable at all times, was no considerable
thoroughfare; no large or important towns lay on its
route, nay, no large villages were situated on its
margins; it was a devious, winding way, leading to
many a homely farm-house, many a small sequestered
hamlet, and affording to the good rustics a
means of carrying their wheat, and eggs, and butter,
or driving their fat cattle and black-faced moorland
sheep to market, but it was not the direct line between
any two points or places worthy of even a
passing notice. It is true, that some twelve or fifteen
miles down the valley, there was a house or two
tenanted by gentry—one that might, by a liberal
courtesy, have been designated as a castle—but above
Ingleborough Hall, to the northwestward, there was
no manor-house or dwelling of the aristocracy at all,
until the road left the <span class='it'>ghylls</span>, as those wild glens are
designated, and joined the line of the great northern
turnpike. It was extremely singular then, to say the
least, that a gay troop of riders should appear suddenly
in that wild spot, so far from anything that
would be likely to attract them; and Annabel sat
some time longer by the window, wondering, and at
the same time fearing, although, in truth, she scarce
knew what, until, at about a mile’s distance, she saw
them halt, and, after a few moments’ conversation
with a farming man on the wayside, as if to inquire
their route, turn suddenly down a narrow by-road
leading to the high narrow bridge of many arches
which crossed the noble river, and gave the only
access to the secluded site of Ingleborough. When
she saw this, however, her perturbation became very
great; for she well knew that there lay nothing in
that direction, except one little market-town, far distant,
and a few scattered farm-houses on the verge of
the moors, so that there could be little doubt that
Ingleborough was indeed their destination. The very
moment that she arrived at this conclusion, Annabel
called a serving-man and bade him run quick to the
vicarage, and pray good Doctor Summers to come
up to her instantly, as she was in great strait, and
fain would speak with him; and, at the same time,
with an energy of character that hardly could have
been expected from one so young and delicate, ordered
the men of the household, including in those
days the fowler and the falconer, and half a dozen
sturdy grooms, and many a supernumerary more,
whom we in these degenerate times have long discarded
as incumbrances, to have their arms in readiness—for
every manor-house then had its regular
armory—and to prepare the great bell of the Hall to
summon all the tenants, on the instant such proceeding
might be needful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the good gray-haired vicar came,
almost breathless from the haste with which he
had crossed the little space between the vicarage
and the manor; and a little while after his wife followed
him, anxious to learn, as soon as possible,
what could have so disturbed the quiet tenor of a
mind so regulated by high principles, and garrisoned
by holy thoughts, as Annabel’s. Their humble dwelling,
though scarce a stone’s throw from the Hall, was
screened by a projecting knoll, feathered with dense
and shadowy coppice, which hid from it entirely the
road by which the horsemen were advancing; so
that the worthy couple had not perceived or suspected
anything to justify the fears of Annabel, until
they were both standing in her presence—then, while
the worthy doctor was proffering his poor assistance,
and his good wife inquiring eagerly what was amiss,
the sight of that gay company of cavaliers, with
feathers waving and scarfs fluttering in the wind,
and gold embroideries glancing to the sun, as, having
left the dusty road, they wheeled through the green
meadows, flashed suddenly upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who can they be? What possibly can bring them
hither?” exclaimed Annabel, pointing with evident
trepidation towards the rapidly approaching horsemen;
“I fear, oh, I greatly fear some heavy ill is
coming—but I have ordered all the men to take their
arms, and the great bell will bring us twenty of the
tenants in half as many minutes. What can it be,
good doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In truth I know not, Annabel,” replied the good
man, smiling cheerfully as he spoke; “in truth I
know not, nor can at all conjecture; but be quite
sure of this, dear girl, that they will do, to us at least,
no evil—they are King Charles’ men beyond doubt,
churchmen and cavaliers, all of them—any one can
see that; and though I know not that we have much
to fear from either party, from them at least we have
no earthly cause for apprehension. I will go forth,
however, to meet them, and to learn their errand—meantime,
fear nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you mistake me,” she answered at once;
“oh! you mistake me very much, for I did not, even
for a moment, fear personally anything; it was for
my poor mother I was first alarmed, and all our good,
kind neighbors, and, indeed, all the country around,
that shows so beautiful and happy this fair evening—oh!
but this civil war is a dread thing, and dread, I
fear, will be the reckoning of those who wake it⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who wake it <span class='it'>without cause</span>, my daughter! A
dreadful thing it is at all times, but it may be a necessary,
aye! and a holy thing—when freedom or religion
are at stake—but we will speak of this again;
for see, they have already reached the farther gate,
and I must speak with them before they enter here,
let them be who they may;” and with the words,
pressing her hand with fatherly affection, “Farewell,”
he said, “be of good cheer, I purpose to return
forthwith,” then left the room, and hurrying
down the steps of the porch, walked far more rapidly
than seemed to suit his advanced years and sedentary
habits across the park to meet the gallant company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gallant company, indeed, it was, and such as
was but rarely seen in that wild region, being the
train of a young gentleman of some eight or nine
and twenty years, splendidly mounted, and dressed
in the magnificent fashion of those days, in a half
military costume, for his buff coat was lined throughout
with rich white satin, and fringed and looped
with silver, a falling collar of rich Flanders lace
flowing down over his steel gorget, and a broad scarf
of blue silk supporting his long silver-hilted rapier—by
his side rode another person, not certainly a menial
servant, and yet clearly not a gentleman of birth
and lineage; and after these a dozen or more of armed
attendants, all wearing the blue scarf and black
feathers of the royalists, all nobly mounted and
accoutred, like regular troopers, with sword and dagger,
pistols and musquetoons, although they wore no
breastplates, nor any sort of defensive armor. A
brace of jet-black greyhounds, without a speck of
white upon their sleek and glistening hides, ran
bounding merrily beside their master’s stirrup, and a
magnificent gosshawk sat hooded on his wrist, with
silver bells and richly decorated jesses. So much
had the ladies observed, even before the old man
reached the party; but when he did so, pausing for a
moment to address the leader, that gentleman at
once leaped down from his horse, giving the rein to
a servant, and accompanied him, engaged apparently
in eager conversation, toward the entrance of the
Hall. This went far on the instant to restore confidence
to Annabel; but when they came so near that
their faces could be seen distinctly from the windows,
and she could mark a well-pleased smile upon the
venerable features of her friend, she was completely
reassured. A single glance, moreover, at the face of
the stranger showed her that the most timid maiden
need hardly feel a moment’s apprehension, even if
he were her country’s or her faction’s foe; for it was
not merely handsome, striking, and distinguished,
but such as indicates, or is supposed to indicate, the
presence of a kindly disposition and good heart.
Annabel had not much time, indeed, for making observations
at that moment, for it was scarce a minute
before they had ascended the short flight of steps,
which led to the stone porch, and entered the door of
the vestibule—a moment longer, and they came into
the parlor, the worthy vicar leading the young man
by the hand, as if he were a friend of ten years’
standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Annabel,” he exclaimed, in a joyous voice, as he
crossed the threshold of the room, “this is the young
Lord Vaux, son of your honored father’s warmest
and oldest friend; and in years long gone by, but unforgotten,
my kindest patron. He has come hither,
bearing letters from <span class='it'>his</span> father—knowing not until
now that you, my child, were so long since bereaved—letters
of commendation, praying the hospitality of
Ingleborough, and the best influence of the name of
Hawkwood, to levy men to serve King Charles in
the approaching war. I have already told him⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How glad, how welcome, doubtless, would have
been his coming,” answered Annabel, advancing
easily to meet the youthful nobleman, although a
deep blush covered all her pale features as she performed
her unaccustomed duty, “had my dear father
been alive, or my poor mother”—casting a rapid
glance towards the invalid—“been in health to greet
him. As it is,” she continued, “the Lord Vaux, I
doubt not, in the least, will pardon any imperfections
in our hospitality, believing that if in aught we err,
it will be error, not of friendliness or of feeling, but
of experience only, seeing I am but a young mistress
of a household. You, my kind friend, and Mistress
Summers, will doubtless tarry with us while my
Lord Vaux gives us the favor of his presence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Loath should I be, indeed, dear lady, thus to intrude
upon your sorrows, could I at all avoid it,”
replied the cavalier; “and charming as it must
needs be to enjoy the hospitalities tendered by such
an one as you, I do assure you, were I myself concerned
alone, I would remount my horse at once,
and ride away, rather than force myself upon your
courtesy. But, when I tell you that my father’s
strong opinion holds it a matter of importance—importance
almost vital to the king, and to the cause of
Church and State in England—that I should levy
some force here of cavaliers, where there be so few
heads of noble houses living, to act in union with
Sir Philip Musgrave, in the north, and with Sir Marmaduke
Langdale, I both trust and believe that you
will overlook the trouble and intrusion, in fair consideration
of the motives which impel me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray—” said she, smiling gaily—“pray, my Lord
Vaux, let us leave, now, apology and compliment—most
unaffectedly and truly I am glad to receive you,
both as the son of my father’s valued friend, and as a
faithful servant of our most gracious king—we will
do our best, too, to entertain you; and Doctor Summers
will aid you with his counsel and experience in
furthering your military levies. How left you the
good earl, your father? I have heard mine speak of
him many times, and ever in the highest terms of
praise, when I was but a little girl—and my poor
mother much more recently, before this sad calamity
affected her so fearfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her answer, as it was intended, had the effect at
once of putting an end to all formality, and setting
the young nobleman completely at his ease; the conversation
took a general tone, and was maintained
on all sides with sufficient spirit, until, when Annabel
retired for a little space to conduct her mother to her
chamber, De Vaux found himself wondering how a
mere country girl, who had lived a life so secluded
and domestic, should have acquired graces both of
mind and manner, such as he never had discovered
in court ladies; while she was struck even in a
greater degree by the frank, unaffected bearing, the
gay wit, and sparkling anecdote, blended with many
a touch of deeper feeling, which characterized the
youthful nobleman. After a little while she reappeared,
and with her was announced the evening meal,
the pleasant sociable old-fashioned supper, and as he
sat beside her, while she presided, full of calm modest
self-possession, at the head of her hospitable
board, with no one to encourage her, or lend her
countenance, except the good old vicar and his
homely helpmate, he could not but draw fresh comparisons,
all in her favor too, betwixt the quiet graceful
confidence of the ingenuous girl before him, and
the <span class='it'>minauderies</span> and meretricious airs of the court
dames, who had been hitherto the objects of his passing
admiration. Cheerfully, then, and pleasantly the
evening passed away; and when upon her little
couch, hard by the invalid’s sick bed, Annabel
thought over the events of the past day, she felt
concerning young De Vaux, rather as if he had been
an old familiar friend, with whom she had renewed
an intercourse long interrupted, than as of a mere
acquaintance whom that day first had introduced,
and whom the next might possibly remove forever.
Something there was, when they met next, at breakfast
on the following morning, of blushing bashfulness
in Annabel which he had not observed, nor she before
experienced; but it passed rapidly away, and left her
self-possessed and tranquil—while surely in the
sparkling eye, the eager haste with which he broke
away from his conversation with Dr. Summers, as
she entered, in his hand half extended, and then half
awkwardly, half timidly, withdrawn, there was much
indication of excited feeling, widely at variance with
the stiff and even formal mannerism inculcated and
practised in the court of the unhappy Charles. It
needs not now, however, to dwell on passing conversations,
to narrate every trifling incident—the
morning meal once finished, De Vaux mounted his
horse, and rode forth in accordance with the directions
of the loyal clergyman, to visit such among the
neighboring farmers as were most likely to be able
to assist him in the levying a horse regiment. A
few hours passed, and he returned full of high spirits
and hot confidence—he had met everywhere
assurances of good will to the royal cause, had succeeded
in enlisting some ten or more of stout and
hardy youths, and had no doubt of finally accomplishing
the object, which he had in view, to the full
height of his aspirations. After dinner, which in
those primitive days was served at noon, he was
engaged for a time in making up despatches for his
father, which having been sent off by a messenger of
his own trusty servants to the castle in Northumberland,
he went out and joined his lovely hostess in the
sheltered garden, which I have described above; and
there they lingered until the sun was sinking in the
west behind the huge and purple headed hills, which
covered the horizon in that direction—the evening
circle and the social meal succeeded, and when they
parted for the night, if Annabel and young De Vaux
could not be said to be enamored, as indeed they
could not yet, they had at least made so much progress
to that end, that each esteemed the other the
most agreeable and charming person it had been
hitherto their fortune to encounter; and, although
this was decidedly the farthest point to which the
thoughts of Annabel extended, when he had laid
down on his bed, with the sweet rays of the harvest
moon flooding his room with quiet lustre, and the
voice of the murmuring rivulet and the low flutter of
the west wind in the giant sycamores blending themselves
into a soft and soothing melody, the young
lord found himself considering how gracefully that
fair pale girl would fill the place, which had been
long left vacant by his mother, in the grand Hall of
Gilsland Castle. Another, and another day succeeded—a
week slipped away—a second and third followed
it, and still the ranks of the royal regiment, though
they were filling rapidly, had many vacancies, and
arms had yet to be provided, and standards, and
musicians—passengers went and came continually
between the castle and the manor; and all was bustle
and confusion in the lone glens of Wharfdale.
Meantime a change was wrought in Annabel’s demeanor,
that all who saw remarked—there was a
brighter glow than ever had been seen before in her
transparent cheeks; her eyes sparkled almost as
brilliantly as Marian’s; her lips were frequently arrayed
in bright and beaming smiles; her step was
light and springy as a young fawn’s upon the
mountain—Annabel was in love, and had discovered
that it was so—Annabel was beloved, and knew it—the
young lord’s declaration and the old earl’s consent
had come together, and the sweet maiden’s heart was
given, and her hand promised, almost before the
asking. Joy! joy! was there not joy in Ingleborough?
The good old vicar’s tranquil air of
satisfaction, the loud and eloquent mirth of his kind-hearted
housewife—the merry gay congratulations of
wild Marian, who wrote from York, half crazy with
excitement and delight—the evident and lovely happiness
of the young promised bride—what pen of
man may even aspire to describe them. All was
decided—all arranged—the marriage was, so far at
least, to be held private, that no festivities nor public
merriment should bruit it to the world, until the civil
strife should be decided, and the king’s power established;
which all men fancied at that day it would
by a single battle—and which, had Rupert wheeled
upon the flank of Essex at Edge-Hill, instead of
chasing the discomfited and flying horse of the
Roundheads miles from the field of battle, would
probably have been the case. The old earl had sent
the wedding gifts to his son’s chosen bride, had
promised to be present at the nuptials, the day of
which was fixed already; but it had been decided,
that when De Vaux should be forced to join the royal
armies, his young wife should continue to reside at
Ingleborough, with her bereaved mother and fond
sister, until the wished-for peace should unite England
once again in bonds of general amity, and the
bridegroom find honorable leisure to lead his wife in
state to his paternal mansions. Days sped away!
how fast they seemed to fly to those young happy
lovers! How was the very hour of their first interview
noted, and marked with the white in the deep
tablets of their minds—how did they, shyly half,
half fondly, recount each to the other the first impressions
of their growing fondness—how did they
bless the cause that brought them thus together—<span class='it'>Proh!
cæca mens mortalium!</span>—oh! the short-sighted
scope of mortal vision!—alas! for one—for both!⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wedding day was fixed, and now was fast
approaching; and hourly was Marian with the good
uncle and his dame expected at the Hall, and wished
for, and discoursed of by the lovers—“and oh!—”
would Annabel say, half sportively and half in earnest—“well
was it for my happiness, De Vaux, that <span class='it'>she</span>
was absent when you first came hither, for had you
seen her first, her far superior beauty, her bright wild
radiant face, her rare arch <span class='it'>naïveté</span>, her flashing wit,
and beautiful enthusiasm, would—<span class='it'>must</span> have captivated
you all at once—and what had then become of
your poor Annabel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then would the young lord vow—and vow in
all sincerity and truth as he believed, that had he
met her first in the most glorious courts of Europe,
with all the gorgeous beauties of the world to rival
her, she would alone have been the choice of his
soul—his soul first touched by her of women!—And
then he would ask in lowered tones, and with a sly
simplicity of manner, whether if <span class='it'>he</span> had loved another,
she could have still loved him; to which with all the
frank and fearless purity, which was so beautiful a
trait in Annabel—“Oh! yes—” she would reply, and
gaze with calm reliance, as she did so, into her lover’s
eyes—“oh yes, dear Ernest—and then how
miserably wretched must I have been, through my
whole life thereafter. Oh! yes, I loved you—though
then I knew it not, nor indeed thought at all about it
until you spoke to me—I loved you dearly—tenderly!—and
I believe it would have almost killed me, to
look upon you afterward as the wife of another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wedding day was but a fortnight distant, and
strange to say, it was the very day two months gone,
which had seen their meeting. Wains had arrived
from Gilsland, loaded with arms and uniforms,
standards and ammunition—two of the brothers of De
Vaux, young gallant cavaliers, had come partly
to officer the men, partly to do fit honor to their
brother’s nuptials. The day, although the season
had now advanced far into brown October, was
sunny, mild and beautiful; the regiment had that
day, for the first time, mustered in arms in Ingleborough
park, and a gay show they made with
glittering casques and corslets, fresh from the armorer’s
anvil, and fluttering scarfs and dancing plumes,
and bright emblazoned banners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was in the act of setting—De Vaux and
Annabel were watching his decline from the same
window in the Hall, whence she had first discovered
his unexpected coming; when, as on that all eventful
evening, a little dust was seen arising on the
high road beyond the river, and in a moment a small
mounted party, among which might be readily descried
the fluttering of female garments!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is my sister—” exclaimed Annabel, jumping
up on the instant, and clasping her hands eagerly—“it
is my dear, dear sister—come, Ernest, come; let
us go meet dear Marian.” No time was lost; but
arm in arm they sallied forth, the lovers; and met
the little train just this side the park gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marian sprang from her horse, light as a spirit of
the air, and rushed into her sister’s arms and clung
there with a long and lingering embrace, and as she
raised her head a bright tear glittered on either silky
eyelash. De Vaux advanced to greet her, but as he
did so, earnestly perusing the lineaments of his fair
sister, he was most obviously embarrassed, his manner
was confused and even agitated, his words
faltered—and <span class='it'>she</span> whose face had been, a second
before, beaming with the bright crimson of excitement,
whose eye had looked round eagerly and
gladly to mark the chosen of her sister—<span class='it'>she</span> turned
as pale as ashes—brow, cheeks, and lips—pale,
almost livid!—and her eye fell abashed, and did not
rise again till he had finished speaking. None noticed
it, but Annabel; for all the party were engaged
in gay congratulations, and, they recovering themselves
immediately, nothing more passed that could
create surmise—but she did <span class='it'>note</span> it, and her heart
sank for a moment; and all that evening she was
unusually grave and silent; and had not her usual
demeanor been so exceedingly calm and subdued,
her strange dejection must have been seen and
wondered at by her assembled kinsfolk.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART THE FIRST.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps there is no place in America where the
people continued to cling so long, and so fondly, to
the relics and traditions of the olden time, as in Boston—their
first era being that of the early settlers,
their second that of the revolution. At the commencement
of my acquaintance with Boston and
Bostonians, I was particularly struck with the prevalence
of this feeling, having found so little of it in
my native city, Philadelphia. Yet I was sorry to
hear from my eastern friends, that comparatively it
was fast subsiding, and that a fancy for modern improvements
(blended with the powerful incentive of
pecuniary interest) was rapidly superseding that
veneration so long cherished for the places and things
connected with the history of their “ancient and
honorable town,” and the founders of their country’s
freedom. On my second visit to Boston I missed
much that on my first I had found still undesecrated.
On my third, but few vestiges remained of the
poetry, the romance, and the quaintness that, with
regard to external objects, had so interested and
amused me in the year 1832. I looked in vain for
the “old familiar faces” of certain antiquated and,
perhaps, unsightly structures that I had delighted to
contemplate as the time-honored habitations of men
with undying names. They were gone, and new
and more profitable buildings erected on their site.
In many of these instances “I could have better
spared a better house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately the charter of the city specifies that
Faneuil Hall is never to be sold, nor can the ground
on which it stands be appropriated to any other purpose.
Except that the market-place in the lower
story is now occupied by shops, the whole edifice
still remains nearly as it was when the walls of its
chief apartment resounded with the acclamations of
the people who discussed, at their town meetings,
those principles that led to their self-emancipation
from the sway of Britain. Acclamations elicited by
the bold and overpowering eloquence of James Otis,
the enthusiastic outbreakings of the impetuous spirit
of Warren, the pure and self-sacrificing patriotism
of Quincy, and the calm but energetic plain sense
of Samuel Adams, backed by the generous liberality
of that wealthy and noble-minded merchant whose
name, as president of the first Congress, leads on the
glorious array of signatures appended to the Declaration
of Independence. Did no one think of preserving
the pen with which those names were written?—the
sacred quill</p>

<p class='pindent'>The full-length portrait of Peter Faneuil stands at
the upper end of the hall, looking like its guardian
spirit. It is a fine copy of a small original that was
painted in his lifetime. In regarding the likeness of
a person of note (provided always that the painter is
a good artist) you can generally judge of its verisimilitude,
by its representing the features of the mind
in conjunction with those of the face. If a well
painted portrait has no particular expression, you
may safely conclude that the sitter had no particular
character. When, at the first glance of a picture,
you are struck with the conviction that the original
<span class='it'>must</span> have looked exactly so, it is because you at
once perceive his mind in his face. Who that has
ever seen it, while it hung so long in the Pennsylvania
Academy of Fine Arts, does not recollect Berthon’s
admirable and life-like portrait of Buonaparte
in the first year of that consulate. Every beholder
was struck with an irresistible conviction of its perfect
and unimpeachable fidelity of character. There,
in his gold embroidered blue coat, his tri-colored
sash, and his buff-leather gauntlets, was the pale,
thin, almost cadaverous young soldier, just returned
from the unwholesome regions of the Nile; with his
dark, uncared-for hair shading his thoughtful brow,
and his deep-set, intense eyes, that looked as if they
could search into the soul of every man they saw.
So self-evident was the truth of this picture, that it
was unnecessary to be aware of its exact accordance
with all the descriptions given at that time of the
republican general, who had just made himself the
chief magistrate of the French people, and was called
only Buonaparte. A few years afterward, when
“the hero had sunk into the king,” and was termed
Napoleon, and when, in becoming more handsome,
his face lost much of its original expression, this picture
was equally valuable, as showing how he had
looked in the early part of his wondrous career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another picture which we feel at once to be a
most faithful representation, is Greuze’s portrait of
Franklin. It was painted by that excellent artist
when the venerable printer, philosopher, author,
statesman (what shall we call him) was living in
Paris. The dress is a coat and waistcoat of dark reddish
silk, trimmed with brown fur. The head is very
bald at the top, and he wears his gray locks plain and
unpowdered. He has that noble expanse of forehead
which is almost always found in persons of extraordinary
intellect. His eye is indicative of strong
sense and benevolence, enlivened with a keen relish
for humor. His whole countenance exhibits that
union of genius and common sense, shrewdness and
kindness, which formed his character. My father
had once in his possession (but lost it by lending) a
fine French engraving taken from this very portrait,
and printed in colors. He had known Dr. Franklin
intimately, and he considered it the most admirable
likeness he had ever seen—in fact the very man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To return to Mr. Faneuil—<span class='it'>his</span> portrait also is
highly characteristic. No one can look at this picture
of a tall, dignified gentleman, in a suit of crimson
velvet and gold, a long lace cravat, and a powdered
wig, according to the patrician costume of his
time, and can view his fine open countenance, without
believing the whole to be a correct portraiture of
the opulent and public spirited merchant who, while
he was yet living, gave its first market-place, with a
hall for the accommodation of public meetings, to
the town that had afforded an asylum to his Huguenot
ancestor. The remains of Peter Faneuil, who died
suddenly in 1743, are interred amid the green shades
of the Granary Burying Ground, so called from the
town granary having been in its immediate vicinity.
This cemetery is close to the Tremont Hotel, and in
view of another “ancient place of graves,” belonging
to the King’s Chapel, which was founded in 1688,
and, in early times, numbered among its congregation
the largest portion of the Boston aristocracy;
and many of their descendants still worship there.
It is built of light brown stone, and is frequently
called the Stone Chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The length, thickness, and luxuriance of the grass,
(which appears to require perpetual mowing,) and the
closeness of the burial mounds, which seem almost
piled upon each other, make it somewhat difficult to
explore the monumental memorials of the old Boston
families, whose first progenitors are slumbering beneath.
A large number of these tombs are sculptured
with armorial bearings, as an evidence that
their mouldering occupants belonged, in their fatherland,
to “gentle blood.” Of the tomb-stones dated
after the revolution, I saw few that bore any indications
of “the boast of heraldry, the pomp of power.”
The founder of Boston, John Winthrop, is interred
in the northwest corner of this cemetery, with his
daughter, Grace Sears, (from whom the present
Sears family is descended,) and his son, Waitstill
Winthrop. The mansion of Governor Winthrop
was a large two-story frame house, surrounded by a
garden, and shaded with aboriginal trees that had
been left standing for the purpose. Its location was
near the old South Church, just below School street.
Its site is now covered with stores; the block of
buildings being termed South Row. I have seen an
old portrait of this chief of the Boston colonists. It
represents him as a tall, thin, dark-complexioned
man, with an oval face, regular features, and a very
serious countenance. He is habited in “a sad colored
suit,” with a white lawn ruff round his neck,
and a black cap on his head. In this burial ground
Cooper has placed the vault of the Lechmere family,
at the entrance of which the mother of Job Pray was
found dead; and from the gallery of the stone chapel
the half maniac father of Lionel Lincoln interrupted
the marriage of his son with Cecil Dynevor, as they
stood at the altar. Though reason may reject the
interesting associations that emanate from fiction,
feeling and fancy always unconsciously adopt them.
It is this which conducts so many travellers to the
shores of Loch Katrine, and sends them in a boat to
the island of Ellen Douglas, though well aware that
the damsel of the lake never in reality existed. I
knew a gentleman who traversed the wilds of Connaught
to visit the sea-beaten castle of Inismore, because
it had been the fancied abode of Glorvina, the
Wild Irish Girl, another charming creation of genius.
And few will wonder at his doing so, who are
familiar with the work that caused the flood-tide of
Miss Owenson’s fortune, and who have, of course,
read and re-read that beautiful letter in which Horatio
describes his first acquaintance with the castle and
its inmates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was yet a stranger in Boston, when a few days
after my arrival I accompanied a lady and gentleman
who were residents in that city, (and excellent
<span class='it'>ciceroni</span>) on an exploring walk into what is called
the North End. This is a very old part of the town,
extending northerly from Court street to Lynn street,
and bounded on its eastern side by the waters of the
harbor, and on the west by those of the estuary
denominated Charles River. Its extreme point is
immediately opposite to Bunker Hill. As it did not
modernize as fast as the other sections of Boston,
and as its old buildings were longer in getting demolished
or furbished up, the <span class='it'>habitans</span> of the North End
lay under the imputation of being an old fashioned
people, sadly deficient in the organ of go-a-headness,
and pitifully submitting to creep on all fours, while the
rest of the community were making unto themselves
wings. There was even a scandalous story circulated
of one of their pastors, (a good old gentleman,
whose nasal elocution had not improved by age,)
uttering in his prayer the words, “Have mercy upon
us miserable offenders,” in a manner that sounded
very much like, “Have mercy upon us miserable
North-enders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give me an idea of the habitations of the early
Bostonians, I was purposely taken through some of
the oldest and crookedest streets; several of which had
pavements so narrow that we had to break rank and
to proceed Indian file; for when we attempted to
walk abreast and the wall was politely ceded to me,
the other lady took the curb-stone, and the gentleman
the gutter. Be it known, however, that a Boston
gutter is merely a minor ravine, edged with wild
flowers; and not a reservoir of liquid mud or a conduit
for dirty water; all the conduits in that city
being sub-terraneous, and entirely out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We saw very old houses, some of time-discolored
brick, and some of wood in many instances unpainted,
and therefore nearly black; in a few, the second
story projected far over the first. Many of the ancient
frame habitations were very large, and must have
been built by people “that were well to do in the
world.” In some, the clap-boards were ornamentally
scolloped; and in many, the window frames
instead of being inserted in the wall, were put on
outside, and looked as if ready to burst forth upon us.
There were primitive porches with seats in them,
sheltered by moss-grown pent-houses, some of which
would have furnished a tolerable crop of that roof-loving
plant the house-leek. There were wooden
balconies, with close heavy balustrades, of the pattern
that looks like a range of innumerable narrow
jugs. In some houses, the balconies were gone, but
the door-windows belonging to them, were still there
all the same; and as they now opened upon nothing,
they looked most dangerous, especially for children
or somnambulists to walk out at. There were street-doors
cut horizontally in half, with steps descending
inside instead of ascending outside. Many of the
houses that stood alone had no front entrance, but
ingress and egress were obtained through a small
unpretending door in the side. This seemed to be a
good plan, when the front was facing the chill blasts
of the northeast. It is very disagreeable to have
your street door blown open by the violence of the
wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an early stage of “our winding way,” we came
to the junction of Union and Marshall streets, and
there I saw a large square block of dark brown
stone, on one side of which was painted in white letters
the words “Boston Stone.” Supposing it to be
one of the landmarks of the city, and something memorable,
I seated myself for a few moments upon
it. I was told by one of my companions, that this
stone had been an object of great controversy among
certain antiquaries of the city. In newspapers a
century old there were advertisements of shopkeepers
and mechanics, who, in giving their locations,
made assurance doubly sure, by stating that they
lived near the Boston Stone. Houses were announced
for sale or hire in the neighborhood of the
Boston Stone. Street-fights and dreadful accidents
happened not far from the Boston Stone. What
then was the Boston Stone? How came it there,
and for what purpose? There was no mention of it
in history. Patriotic picturesque people thought it
was the foundation-stone of a flag staff or a beacon-mast;
and it is certain that the top or upper surface
of the block exhibited a slight circular cavity, evidently
made on purpose for something: though practical
people contended that the hollow was not deep
enough to hold anything. I cherished for two or
three months the persuasion that the Boston Stone
was either a remarkable relic connected with great
events, or else that it had been placed there when
the peninsula was first laid out for a town, as a mark
to designate where some place left off, and another
place began; or perhaps to denote the very centre
of the settlement. But “the shadows, clouds and
darkness” that rested upon all my conjectures, were
very prosaically dispelled just before my departure
from Boston, by a most unexciting account obtained
through the medium of a grandson of “the oldest
inhabitant” of that neighborhood. The real solution
of the mystery was so very natural, that none but
very commonplace people would believe it. It
simply implied that a certain apothecary of the olden
time being in want of a very large mortar, and unable
to obtain one ready made, procured this block
of stone and set his boys to hollowing it out for the purpose.
They made a beginning, but soon found that
the stone was too hard and the labor too great;
and having taken a spite at the obdurate block, they
shoved it out of doors and left it on the pavement in
front of the shop. From hence no one took the
trouble to remove it, and finding that the neighbors
began to date from its vicinity, the apothecary’s boys
made it more <span class='it'>distingué</span> by inscribing it with the title of
the Boston Stone—How a plain tale will put us down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after quitting the Boston Stone, we came
to a house at the corner of Union and Hanover
streets, which was shown to me as the one in which
Dr. Franklin was born. It is of two stories, and built
partly of brick and partly of wood. The lower part
was now occupied by a little shop, with a blue bell
as a sign. Adjoining it in Hanover street was a dark
low grocery store into which you descended by a step.
It looked exactly as if it had been the soap and candle
shop of Josiah Franklin. It was easy to imagine
poor Ben. serving customers behind the old counter;
cutting candle-wicks into lengths; and snatching, at
intervals, a few minutes to read a little in hidden
books when nobody saw him. An aged and excellent
woman, who had passed her life in this part of
the town, told me at a subsequent period, that she
well remembered, when a little girl, seeing the
old corner house (the dwelling part of the establishment,)
pulled down, and the present one
erected in its stead. The original corner house had
always been regarded as one of the habitations of
the Franklin family, and the adjoining old one-story
shop (now the grocery) as theirs. It seems to me
highly probable that the elder Franklin <span class='it'>did</span> live in
Milk street (as is generally believed) at the time his
son Benjamin was born, and that the infant <span class='it'>was</span> wrapped
in a blanket and carried over the way to the old
South Church to be christened. His baptism is noted
in the register of the church, and the date is the same
as that of his birth. This speedy performance of the
rite of baptism was in accordance with the custom of
the times. The Milk street house was a small two-story
frame building, and was accidentally burnt in
1810. On the spot has since been erected a three-story
furniture warehouse. It is but a few steps from
the corner of Washington street, opposite to the Old
South. There was an old printing office just back of
it; and it is said that Josiah Franklin relinquished the
Milk street house to his son James the printer, and
removed with his wife and the younger children to
Hanover street, and there carried on the soap and
candle business, in the dark low one-story shop that is
still there: living in the adjoining house at the corner.
That the parents of Franklin were residents of the
North End at the time of their death there can be no
doubt, as they were interred in the North Burying
Ground on Copp’s Hill. Many years ago their remains
were exhumed, and transferred to the Granary
burial place in Tremont street, at the expense
of several gentlemen of Boston. A neat monument
of granite has been erected upon the mound that
covers their ashes; and in the front of the little obelisk
is inserted a slab of slate, a part of the original grave
stone on Copp’s Hill. This humble medallion bears
the names of Josiah Franklin and Abiah his wife,
with the date of their deaths. I regarded this monument
with much interest, as reflecting back upon his
lowly but respectable parents a portion of the honor so
universally accorded to the great man their son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having diverged from Hanover street to the North
Square, we soon found ourselves in front of two very
old and remarkable houses; one of which had been the
residence of Governor Hutchinson, and the other of
William Clarke, a wealthy merchant of the early part
of the last century. Both were large old-fashioned
buildings, their sides and chimneys overgrown with
the scarlet-flowering creeper-vine. Above the front-door
of the Hutchinson House, was the wooden balcony
from which “Stingy Tommy,” as he was
disrespectfully called by the populace, sometimes
addressed the restive and stiffnecked people whom it
was his hard lot to govern; and by whom he was so
much disliked, that whether he did well or ill they
were resolved not to be pleased. Perhaps the primary
cause of his unpopularity may be traced to his
parsimonious habits, or at least to the stories circulated
of them. No man that is noted for a mean and
avaricious disposition ever was or ever can be liked,
either in private life or in a public capacity. However
he may attempt to disguise it by an occasional
act of liberality, the sordid spirit that is in him will
be always creeping out, and exciting disgust and
contempt. Yet (as is often the case with such
persons) Governor Hutchinson spent much upon
show and finery. At the time his house was sacked
by the mob (when he narrowly escaped with his life)
from this balcony were thrown the splendid brocade
gowns and petticoats of his wife, with her laced
caps, and numerous ornamental articles of dress and
furniture. A bonfire was made of them in the street
before the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman who piloted us on this walk through
the North End was acquainted with the occupants
of the Clarke House, (much the most curious of the
two,) therefore we stopped in, and were courteously
shown its principal apartments. It was built by Mr.
Clarke, in the time of Queen Anne, and was after
him occupied by Sir Henry Frankland, and called,
for awhile, the Frankland House. It had a large,
wide entrance hall, with a parlor on each side. All
the ceilings were much too low for the taste of the
present times; and a low ceiling always causes a
room to look smaller than it really is. The walls of
the left hand parlor had been covered with rich
tapestry, over which a modern wall-paper was now
pasted. A small portion of the papering being peeled
off, we saw part of the tapestry beneath. But the
other parlor had been evidently the room of state.
The floor required no carpet, for it was <span class='it'>parqueté</span> all
over with small square pieces of American wood,
comprising, as we were told, fifty different sorts or
specimens; the light-colored pieces forming the
ground-work, and the dark ones the figure or pattern.
At the first glance it resembled an oil-cloth, or rather
(to adopt a very homely comparison) it was not unlike
the block-work bed quilts that our grandmothers
took such pains in making. On this floor there was
a border all round: and in the centre the marquetry
represented a large swan with a crown on its head,
and a chain round its breast. This was the cognizance
of the Clarke family. Those conversant with
heraldry know that there is always a reason, either
historical, traditionary, or allegorical, for the introduction
of certain strange symbols into a coat of
arms. We were told that this tesselated floor had
cost fifteen hundred dollars. The walls of the room
were divided into compartments, edged with rich
gilded mouldings; each containing an oil painting,
tolerably good, but very vividly colored. The subjects
were beyond our comprehension. We did not
know whether they were what the drawing-masters
call figure-pieces, or whether they were landscapes
with figures in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the room over this parlor the chimney-piece was
of marble, decorated with a rich and admirably executed
carving of flowers, fruit, and Indian corn,
beautifully arranged, and descending down the sides
as far as the hearth. Above the mantle-piece was
a very <span class='it'>mediocre</span> picture, in a narrow gilt frame, inserted
in the wall. This painting represented a boy
and girl, evidently brother and sister. The boy is
presenting something that is either a peach or an
apple to the girl, who is dressed in a ruffled night-gown
and sitting on the side of a couch. The young
gentleman is standing upright, habited in a rich suit
of blue and gold, ornamented at the wrist with deep
cuffs of white lace. On his legs are white silk stockings,
ascending above his knees, and buskins laced
with gold cord. Neither of the children are looking
towards each other, but both are staring out of the
picture, and fixing their very large eyes on the spectator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were told that Cooper had visited this house
previous to commencing Lionel Lincoln. Changing
its location to Tremont street, he has described it as
the mansion of Mrs. Lechmere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few of our American cities have retained their old
family domiciles as long as the town of Boston, and
they attest the opulence of many of its early inhabitants.
However, they are fast disappearing; the
large portions of ground that they occupy, surrounded
with their gardens and lofty trees, having become
too valuable to escape being converted to more profitable
purposes. When I first knew Boston, the
spacious domain of Gardiner Green extended along
Pemberton Hill, far back of Somerset street, including
garden, shrubbery, and pasture ground, from
whence I was sometimes disturbed at night by the
tinkling of a cow-bell, which seemed to me strange
in the very heart of a large city. Near it, on Tremont
street, stood, with its pilasters and tall windows,
the mansion of Jonathan Philips, looking like the
residence of an old English nobleman. It had a
smooth green lawn in front, and an elevated terrace,
which was ascended by a lofty flight of stone steps,
bordered with vases of exotics; and among its fine
shade trees was the beautiful mountain ash, with its
clusters of light scarlet berries. It was built, and
originally occupied, by Mr. Faneuil, uncle to the
gentleman who bestowed the town-hall on Boston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to the house of Governor Philips stood the
residence of the talented and unfortunate Sir Harry
Vane, who had come over with the early settlers,
and afterwards been appointed governor of the province
of Massachusetts. He returned to England
during the protectorate of Cromwell; and after the
restoration, was committed to the Tower for the republican
principles he persisted in advocating.
Charles the Second had him tried on a charge of high
treason, and he was beheaded on Tower Hill—behaving
on the scaffold with the utmost composure
and dignity. He attempted to address the people, but
the drums and trumpets were sounded to drown his
voice. This house of Sir Harry Vane was near two
centuries old. It was a large brick building, with a
garden at the side. The antique back casements still
retained the small diamond-shaped panes set in lead;
but, when I saw the house, its front windows looked
as if they had been modernized about a century ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On my last visit to Boston, about two years since,
I found that all the above-mentioned old mansions
had been demolished, and their places filled with
rows of modern structures suited to the utilitarian
spirit of the times. The old Coolidge house, in Bowdoin
Square, was still standing in 1840. It also is
a large brick building, the bricks much darkened and
discolored with time and damp. The house is almost
hidden by enormous old trees, which cast their impervious
branches so close to the windows that I
wondered how its inhabitants could possibly see to
do anything, unless they burned lamps or candles all
day long. The dense gloominess of shade that environed
this mansion, reminded me of the commencement
of one of Moore’s earliest poems.</p>

<div><h1><a id='bro'></a>THE BROTHER AND SISTER.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. EMMA C. EMBURY.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days of my early childhood, the little village
of ——, separated by green hills and broad fields
from the busy city, formed one of the pleasantest
summer resorts of the wealthy inhabitants of New
York. Many a stately villa was reared upon the
banks of the Hudson, many a neat country-house
sheltered itself within the winding lanes which traversed
the village, for its vicinity to the great mart
offered irresistible temptations to those whose hands
were chained to the galley of commerce, while their
hearts were still wedded to nature. One of the fairest
pictures in the “chambers of mine imagery” is
that of a large old-fashioned mansion, seated in the
midst of a garden “too trim for nature, and too rude
for art,” where a long avenue of cherry trees threw
a pleasant shade across the lawn, while a rude swing,
suspended between two of these sturdy old denizens
of the soil, afforded a cool and delightful lounge to
the studious and imaginative child. My earliest days
were passed in that pleasant home, and my earliest
lessons of wisdom learned in the school of that
pretty village; therefore it is that my thoughts love
to linger around those scenes, and therefore it is that
I have fancied others might find something of interest
in <span class='it'>one</span> of my reminiscences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My shortest road to school led through a narrow
green lane, rarely traversed by the gay vehicles
which dashed along the main avenues of the village,
and I was delighted to find such a quiet and shady
path, where the turf was always so soft, and the air
so fragrant with the breath of flowers. But I was
soon induced to take a wide circuit rather than pass
the solitary cottage which stood within that secluded
lane. It was a low one-story building, with a broad
projecting roof, throwing the narrow windows far
into shade; and, as if to add to its sombre appearance,
some former occupant had painted the house a
dull lead color, which, by the frequent washings of
the rain, and powderings of wayside dust, had
assumed the grayish tint that gave to the cottage its
distinctive appellation. Every village has its haunted
house, and an evil name had early fallen on the
“gray cottage.” Behind it, and so near that three
paces from the little porch would lead a person to its
very brink, was a deep and rocky ravine, forming a
basin for the waters of a rapid brook, which, after
flowing in sunshine and music through half the village,
fell with sullen plash into the gloom of this
wild dell. Some dark and half forgotten tale of
guilt had added the horrors of superstition to the
natural melancholy of the place, and few of the
humbler inhabitants of the neighborhood would have
been willing to stand after sunset on the brink of the
Robbers’ Glen. It was said that the house, in former
times, had been the abode of wicked and desperate
men. The earth of the cellar beneath it was heaved
up with hillocks like graves, and supernatural sounds
had been heard to issue from these mysterious
mounds. For many years it had stood untenanted,
and the boys of the village often amused themselves
by pelting it, at a cautious distance, with stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a “haunted house” had great attractions for
the mind of one who revelled in fancies of the wild
and wonderful. I was exceedingly anxious to behold
the interior of the lonely cottage, which had now
become invested with so much dignity in my eyes,
and finding a few companions of like spirit, we determined
to visit it. We accordingly fixed upon a
certain Saturday afternoon, and determined to find
some means of ingress into the barred and bolted
cottage. A gay and light-hearted troop were we,
as we scrambled over rail fences, gathered our
aprons full of wild flowers, or chased the bright butterflies
which mocked our glad pursuit. But as we
entered the lane our merry shouts of laughter ceased,
each looked earnestly in the face of the other, as if,
for the first time, sensible of the mysterious importance
of our undertaking, and, but for shame, several
would have retraced their steps. I believe not one
of us was insensible to the gloom which seemed
suddenly to fall upon us, and as we looked towards
the cottage, standing in the deep shadow of a spreading
elm, while all else within the lane was glistening
in the slant beams of the declining sun, we almost
feared to approach the darkened spot. Cautiously
advancing, however, and peeping through the rusted
keyhole, we found our curiosity entirely baffled by
the total darkness of the interior. It was proposed
that we should climb the fence and attempt an entrance
from the rear of the building, where we
should be less likely to be interrupted or discovered
by wayfarers, and after a brief consultation, held in
hurried whispers, we resolved upon the daring feat.
Silently treading the margin of the Robbers’ Glen,
we reached the back porch of the little cottage, and
beheld one of the window shutters open. We looked
into the apartment but saw nothing save the naked
walls of the dilapidated room, and as one of our party
turned the latch of the door, to our great astonishment,
it yielded to the touch and allowed us free entrance.
Half frightened at our own success, we
stood huddled together in the narrow passage, hesitating
to advance, when suddenly a tall woman, clad
in the deepest black, and displaying a countenance
as white and (as it seemed to our excited fancies) as
ghostly and rigid as a sheeted corpse, stood in the
midst of us. How we ever got out of the house I
cannot tell. I remember our desperate speed, the
wild and headlong haste with which we threw ourselves
over the low fence, and the total exhaustion
we felt when once fairly escaped from that frightful
place. As we lay on the grass, to rest before returning
home, each one told her own story of that terrible
apparition. None had heard a footstep when that
fearful woman came among us; none had seen her
approach, and though the sound of our own buzzing
voices, and the fixed attention with which we were
just then regarding the door of the apartment, which
we wished yet dreaded to enter, might easily account
for both these circumstances, yet we all came to the
conclusion that we had seen a ghost, or, at the least,
a witch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following Sunday we were scarcely less
alarmed, for, just as the services were commencing,
the same tall figure, arrayed in deep mourning and
veiled to her very feet, slowly proceeded up the aisle
and took her seat on the step of the altar. My blood
ran cold as I looked upon her, and when I afterwards
heard that she had recently become the occupant of
the gray cottage, my dread of her supernatural powers
gave place to a belief that she was in some way or
other mysteriously connected with the guilty deeds
of which that cottage had been the scene. I did not
trouble myself to remember that the events which
had flung such horror around the Robbers’ Glen must
have occurred at least half a century previous, and
therefore could have little to do with a woman yet in
the prime of life. The curiosity which her presence
excited was not confined to the children of the village.
Her tall stature, her sombre garb, her veiled
face, and her singular choice of a place of abode
excited the conjectures of many an older and wiser
head. But whatever interest her appearance had
awakened, it was not destined to be satisfied. Those
who, led by curiosity or real kindness, sought to visit
her, were repulsed from the threshold; no one was
allowed to enter her house; all prying inquiries were
silenced, either by stern reserve or bitter vituperations;
even the village pastor was refused admittance
to her solitude; and, after months and even
years, as little was known of her as on the day she
first appeared. She lived entirely alone; once in
each week she was seen walking towards the city,
and on Sunday she was regularly to be found at the
foot of the pulpit—but beyond this nothing was to be
discovered. Few, very few, had ever distinctly seen
the face whose paleness gleamed out from the folds
of her thick veil, and, after some time, the people
found other objects of interest, while the children
carefully avoided all approach to the haunted cottage,
and could scarcely repress a shudder of horror as
they heard the low rustle of her dusky garments on
each returning Sunday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years passed on; circumstances occurred to remove
me from the village, and the various changes
which the heart experiences between the period of
joyous childhood and earnest womanhood, had
almost effaced from my mind all recollection of the
“black witch,” when I was unexpectedly and rather
strangely made acquainted with her true history. It
was a tale of ordinary trials and sorrows, such as
might have befallen many others, and yet there are
peculiarities in the sufferings of every individual as
strongly marked as are the traits of character.
There was no supernatural interest in her story, but
it invested her in my mind with the dignity of unmerited
sorrow, and it enables me to open for your
perusal, gentle reader, another of the many strange
written pages of human nature.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'>For more than twelve years Madeline Graham had
been an only child, the darling of her invalid mother,
and the pride of her doting father, when the birth of
a brother opened a new channel for the affections of
all the family. During the earliest period of his infancy
the child seemed feebly struggling for existence,
but he gradually acquired strength to resist the
frequent attacks of disease, and though he gave no
promise of robust health, his constitution seemed
sufficiently invigorated to warrant a hope of prolonged
life. The most unwearied exertions, however,
were necessary, and his guidance over the very
threshold of being was a task of more difficulty than
the lifelong care of a hardy and healthy child. Yet
the anxiety which his precarious state awakened,
and the constant attention which he required, seemed
to endear him the more closely to the little family.
He became their idol, the object of their incessant
solicitude, and comfort, happiness, even life itself
was sacrificed to his welfare. Ere he had attained
his third year, Mrs. Graham, who had long been in
declining health, sank beneath the fatigue and anxiety
she had endured, while, with her dying breath, she
enjoined upon Madeline the most devoted attention
to her darling boy. Madeline scarcely needed such
admonition, for, from his very birth, her brother had
been the object of her passionate love; but such a
charge, given at such a solemn moment, sank deep
into the heart of the young and sensitive girl. Falling
on her knees beside her mother, she uttered a
solemn vow that no earthly affection and no other
duty should ever induce her to place her brother’s
interests secondary to her own. A smile of grateful
tenderness lit up the face of the dying woman, and
her last glance thanked Madeline for the self-sacrifice
to which she had thus unconsciously pledged herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that hour the young Alfred became his sister’s
especial charge. Young as she was, her father
knew that he could trust her latent strength of character,
and when she took her brother, even as a
child, to her bosom, he felt assured that his boy
would never need a mother’s care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madeline Graham was no common character.
Though she had scarcely counted her fifteenth
summer, she had grown up tall and stately, with a face
almost severe in its fixed and classical beauty, while
her manners, calm almost to coldness, were scarcely
such as are usually found connected with youthful
feeling and girlish simplicity. Educated solely by
her parents, Madeline had acquired some of the
characteristic traits of both. To her mother’s morbid
sensibility and enthusiasm she united her father’s
reserve and fixedness of purpose. She possessed
strong passions, but an innate power of repressing
them seemed born with them. Her love for truth
was unbounded; even the common courtesies of
society seemed to her but as so many fetters on the
limbs of the goddess of her idolatry, and, therefore,
even in her girlhood, her manners had become
characterized by a sincerity almost amounting to
<span class='it'>brusquerie</span>. Her talents were of the highest order,
and her habits of reflection, which were singularly
developed in one so young, enabled her to reap a
rich harvest of knowledge from her father’s careful
culture. She was one to be admired, and praised,
and wondered at, but she was scarcely calculated to
awaken affection. The spontaneous gush of feeling,
the guileless frankness of a heart that knows no evil
and dreads no danger, the warm sympathy of a
youthful nature, the sweet susceptibility which,
though dangerous to its possessor, is yet so winning
a trait of girlish character—all these attributes,
which seem to belong to the spring-time of life, even
as the buds and blossoms are inseparably connected
with the renewed youth of the visible creation, were
wanting to Madeline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was from the religious opinions of her parents
that the deepest tint of coloring was imparted
to the mind of Madeline. Mrs. Graham, a lineal
descendant of one of the sternest and most intolerant
of the puritans, had early united herself to one of the
strictest of strict sects, and had been accustomed to
practise a system of self-denial as rigid, if not quite
as visible, as the penances of cloistered austerity.
The impulses of innocent gaiety, the promptings of
harmless vanity, the wanderings of youthful fancy
were regarded by her only as evidences of a sinful
nature, which ought to awaken remorse as keen as
that which visits the penitent bosom of deep-dyed
guilt. In the enthusiasm of her early zeal she seemed
lifted above the weaknesses of humanity, and even
the gray-headed members of the Christian community
looked upon her as a chosen servant of the truth.
But her excitement had been too great; the hour of
reaction came, and it was when lukewarmness and
weariness had taken full possession of her feelings
for a season, that she first met with her future husband.
Ever in extremes, an earthly passion now
absorbed the heart which had consumed its energies
in zeal without knowledge, and she married Mr.
Graham without allowing herself to look upon the
broad line of separation which lay between them.
Had she ever made religion a question she would
have learned the fact; for if good taste forbade him
to obtrude his opinions upon others, yet love of truth
prevented him from seeking to conceal them. Mr.
Graham was a skeptic. The great truths of revealed
religion were to him but as fables to amuse the multitude;
and while in the works of creation he recognised
the hand of a Deity, he read not in the hearts
of men the necessity of a Redeemer. Mrs. Graham
was horror-stricken when she discovered that her
husband was not a Christian, and in proportion as
the ardor of youthful passion faded into the tender
light of conjugal affection, the terrible abyss which
yawned between them became more painfully visible
to her sight. The attempt to change his opinions
again awakened her slumbering zeal, and with all
the penitence of one who was conscious of having
fallen from a state of elevated piety, she endeavored to
make amends for her temporary alienation by renewed
devotion. But her system of ascetic severity
was little calculated to make religion attractive to
her husband. The “beauty of holiness” was hidden
beneath the sackcloth and ashes with which her mistaken
judgment endued it, and Mr. Graham learned
to look upon her piety as the <span class='it'>one defect</span>, rather than
the <span class='it'>crowning grace</span>, in his wife’s character. Her
sincere affection, and a desire to preserve domestic
harmony, at length compelled her to give up all
attempts to change her husband’s opinions, and she
was therefore doomed to cherish a secret sorrow
which wasted her very life away. The ascetic devotion
which seemed so unlovely to the husband, produced
a very different effect upon the imagination of
Madeline. Accustomed to regard her mother as the
best of human beings, she early learned to reverence
and imitate her fervent zeal. Her reserve of character
induced her to conceal her impressions even from
the mother who labored to deepen them, and no one
suspected the severe self-discipline which, even in
childhood, she practised in imitation of her parent’s
example. Her father, who, while despising Christianity,
yet paid it the involuntary homage of considering
it a very proper safeguard for women and
children, did not attempt to interfere in her religious
education. He contented himself with cultivating
the field of mind, and left her mother to sow her
moral nature with the tares of prejudice along with
the seed of true piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madeline had scarcely attained her twentieth year
when a sudden and violent illness deprived her of
her father, and left her the sole guardian of her
young brother. Upon looking into Mr. Graham’s
affairs, it was found that his profession had only procured
for him a comfortable subsistence, and, as his
income died with him, the orphans were almost penniless.
The small house which they had long occupied,
together with its furniture and a library of some
value, were all that remained. To convert these
into money was Madeline’s first care, and her next
step was to invest the amount thus obtained in the
name of her brother, as a fund for his education and
future subsistence. For herself she seemed to have
no anxieties, and with a degree of disinterestedness,
as rare as it was praiseworthy, she determined to derive
her own maintenance from the labor of her
hands. With characteristic energy she made all her
arrangements without consulting any one, or asking
the advice of her father’s best friends. The bold
self-reliance which formed her most striking and
least amiable trait was now fully developed, and she
felt no need of other aid than that of her own strong
mind. She had a deep design to work out in future—a
darling scheme to mature—a hope, which in her
stern nature assumed the form of a determination to
compass, and all sacrifices seemed light which could
aid her to a successful issue. Need I add, that her
brother was the object of all her future aspirations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred Graham had already given evidence of
precocious genius which seemed fully to justify
Madeline’s ambition. Nature in his case had displayed
her usual compensating kindness, and since
she had bestowed on him a dwarfed and diminutive
form, a delicate and fragile body, made amends by
giving him a countenance of almost feminine beauty,
and a mind filled with the most exquisite perceptions.
He was born a poet. His fervid feelings, his nervous
temperament, his delicate sense of beauty in the
moral and physical world—even the very fragility
of constitution which shut him out from the rude
conflicts of real life, and confined him within the
limits of the fairyland of reverie—all seemed to
point out his future vocation. Too young to frame
in numbers the fancies of his childish hours, he yet
breathed into his sister’s ear the eloquent words of
pure and passionless enthusiasm, and Madeline’s
heart thrilled with high hopes of his future glory.
But she did not suffer nature to direct his course.
Long ere the child had seriously commenced the
work of education, she had destined him to become
an apostle of Christianity to the benighted world of
paganism. Imaginative, high minded, stern, and
self-sacrificing, Madeline was just such a woman as
in the olden time might have embroidered the cross
upon the mantle of her best beloved one, and sent
him forth to fight the battles of the holy church.
But the missionary of modern days has a far more
difficult and therefore far nobler office to perform.
Amid belted knights and men-at-arms to do battle
with myriads of the Paynim foe is a lighter task
than that which falls upon him, who goes forth alone
and single handed to face the more insidious foes of
ignorance and sin amid the blinded and perverse
heathen. Yet such was the high and holy duty to
which Madeline destined her brother, while her own
ambition was limited to the hope of being the companion
of his toils and his labors. She looked forward
to the time when they should go forth hand in
hand into the howling wilderness of superstition,
with the gospel as a light to their feet and a lamp to
their path, while they scattered the blessings of truth
among the benighted idolaters of distant lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Alfred advanced in life he learned the full
extent of his sister’s sacrifices for his welfare. He
saw her relinquishing all the intellectual pleasures
she had once enjoyed, and devoting herself day and
night to the humble labors of the needle. He noticed
her attention to his most trifling wishes, and he did
not fail to observe that while his dress was of the
neatest and finest texture, and his food of the delicate
kind which best suited the capricious appetite of an
invalid, Madeline practised the strictest economy in
all that affected only her own individual comfort.
Yet Alfred did not love Madeline with the entire
affection which could alone repay her devotedness.
There was too much awe, too much fear blended
with his feelings towards her. Her strong mind and
stern integrity seemed ever ready to rebuke the
vacillating temper and morbid sensibility of the
youth. Superior to temptations which had no power
over herself, she had little charity for the failings of
another; and the boyish errors, often but the earliest
trial of principles which the world will hereafter put
to a far more severe test—were regarded by her as
heavy sins. Educated in the seclusion of home, she
could not imagine the dangers which beset a boy
from his first entrance into the miniature world of a
large school. Instead of rewarding with her approbation
the first struggles of principle with passion in
the youthful heart, she seemed only shocked and
mortified that any conflict should have been necessary,
and was more keenly sensible to the weakness
which had required defence, than to the strength
which had offered resistance. Such mistaken views
of character soon checked the flow of confidence
between them. Alfred could not open his whole
heart to one who was incapable of comprehending
all his feelings, and though he never needed a
mother’s care, he early learned the want of a mother’s
sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madeline had seen sufficient proofs of Alfred’s
facile temper and instability of purpose to dread
his introduction into scenes of greater temptation,
and, vainly fancying that he would be safer any
where than in the busy city, she preferred that he
should enter a distant college. At the age of seventeen
he was removed from his sister’s influence to
enter upon his new course of studies, and although
at first truly unhappy at this separation from his only
relative, it was not long before the absence of her
keen eye and stern rebuke became a positive relief
to him. Hitherto his life had passed amid the sombre
shades of domestic life, and with all Madeline’s
noble traits of character, she lacked the tact, so
truly feminine, which enables a woman to throw
sunshine around the humblest home. The cheerful
song, the pleasant jest, the merry voice, the bright
smile, the buoyant step—all the lighter graces without
which a woman’s character, however elevated and
noble, is but as a Corinthian column without its
capital, or as a rose without its perfume—were
wanting to the unbending nature of Madeline. The
world was to her a scene of probation and preparation,
and to waste a thought upon enlivening its
grave duties seemed to her as idle as planting flowers
around a sepulchre. When therefore Alfred
found himself amid a throng of young men from
every part of the country—some ambitious of renown,
some fond of study for its own sake, some
utterly careless of present duties, some slothful and
indifferent to honor, but all equally alive to pleasurable
excitement and equally eager in the pursuit
of amusement, he felt as if he had suddenly been
transported to a world of which he had never dreamed.
His susceptible temper rendered him an easy prey to
the lures of gay society. Intellectual enjoyments
mingled their pure odors with the fumes of the wine
cup, and the refinements of elegant taste served to
veil the native deformity of vice, until, long before
he had learned the danger of his position, he was
bound in the strong toils of sensual indulgence.
Full of intellect, and wonderfully acute in his perceptions,
he soon became distinguished for his
genius, and the heart of his sister was often gladdened
by tidings of his success. But she knew not
that he was drinking from more turbid waters than
those which flow from the fountain of wisdom—she
dreamed not that the offering which she hoped to
bring pure and unpolluted to the altar of Heaven was
already blemished and unworthy to be presented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alfred Graham was not designed by nature to be a
votary of evil. Temptation had found him weak to
resist, but conscience was still true to her charge,
and the youth was as free from habitual vice as he
was destitute of unsullied virtue. When the vacations
brought him to his quiet home, the better
feelings of his nature were ever aroused; he respected
the virtue of his sister’s character, and
when surrounded by that pure atmosphere which
envelopes real goodness, he forgot even to harbor a
sinful thought. But day by day the profession to
which he was destined became more repugnant to
his feelings, and after deferring as long as possible
the announcement of his wishes, he at length summoned
courage to reveal the truth to his sister. The
blow fell upon Madeline with almost stunning violence.
He had just left college crowned with honors
and flushed with success, and Madeline was exulting
in the hope of his future usefulness, when he revealed
to her his change of purpose. The first intimation
of his unwillingness to devote himself to the church,
almost drove her to frenzy. All the violence of her
secret nature broke forth in the fearful threats of
temporal and eternal punishment which she predicted
for such apostacy, and Alfred’s feeble temper
was actually crushed beneath the weight of her indignation.
He trembled at the storm which he had
raised, and when, after days of entreaty and expostulation,
Madeline, the stern, proud Madeline, even
knelt at his feet, and implored the child of her affections
to listen to the voice of God, speaking by the
lips of her who had ever been as a mother to his
heart, the weak youth yielded to her prayers and
promised what he well knew he could not conscientiously
perform. His was not the free-will offering
of talents and time and health and strength in the
service of the Redeemer. He entered the sanctuary
as one driven onward by irresistible force, not as
one drawn by the cords of love and piety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed on and taught Alfred a lesson of
deep hypocrisy. His timid and feeble nature could
neither resist the influence of evil nor brave its consequences,
and therefore it was that the fair face of
the youth became more and more characterized by
sanctity in proportion as his heart became less susceptible
of its influences. Happy is it for mankind
that the eye rarely pierces beneath the veil which
conceals the hideous depravity of the heart. Who
but would have shrunk from the delicate beauty of
Alfred’s gentle countenance—who but would have
shuddered at the contemplation of those clear blue
eyes, that feminine complexion, the delicate rose
tint of his thin cheek, and the exceeding loveliness
of his chiselled and flexible lips, if the dark mass of
evil thoughts which lay beneath that fair seeming,
could have been discerned. Yet Alfred was far
from being happy. Unstable as water, he had no
power over his own impulses, and remorse preyed
upon him, even while he sought to drown his
senses in indulgence. Conscience was his perpetual
tormentor, and yet a constant course of sinning
and repenting left him neither time nor will to struggle
effectually with his errors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a still darker change came upon his character.
His health, which had several times required a suspension
of his studies, began again to fail, a short
time before the period fixed upon for his ordination,
and he eagerly seized the opportunity of deferring
the dreaded ordeal. The physicians ordered perfect
relaxation from all mental labors, and unfortunately
for his future peace, the listlessness of unwonted
idleness led him to examine a chest of old papers,
the accumulated records of many years, where he accidentally
met with a catalogue of his father’s library.
Alfred was so young at the time of his father’s death
that he retained little recollection of him, and Madeline
had carefully kept him in ignorance of those
skeptical opinions which had so grieved both mother
and daughter. It was with no little surprise, therefore,
that Alfred found the names of so great a number
of infidel works among his father’s books. He
pondered long upon the subject, and at length conjectured
the truth. This excited his interest, and a
vague curiosity, awakened rather by a belief in
his sister’s desire to conceal from him his father’s
opinions, led him secretly to procure the prohibited
volumes. Upon the feeble mind of one who was
“blown about by every wind of doctrine,” and who
yearned after worldly pleasures while he shrunk
with unutterable disgust from religious duties, the
subtleties of the skeptics had a most fatal effect.
He had never been well grounded in the faith, and
the doubts now suggested to his mind were exactly
such things as in his present state of feeling he would
gladly have adopted as truths. These six months of
respite from theological studies were spent in the
careful perusal of all skeptical writings, and when
Alfred resumed his former pursuits the plague spot
of infidelity had already given evidence of the fatal
disease which was spreading over his moral nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If my tale were designed only for the eye of the
student of human nature, I might dwell long upon
the strange incongruity of feeling and action, the
wonderful contrariety between principle and practice,
and all the complicated workings of a wayward
heart, which characterized the deceptive course of
the young student. With his usual timid hypocrisy
he concealed every real feeling, every genuine impulse.
His conduct was apparently irreproachable,
his principles seemed unimpeachable, and he even
schooled himself to come forward and enrol himself
beneath the banner of the cross, when he was but
too conscious that he had already trampled the holy
emblem beneath his feet. Why did he carry his
deceit to such an awful extent? Alas! who can tell
just where the waves of sin may stay their whelming
force? He feared the world’s dread laugh at his
apostacy, he shrunk from the scorn of all good men,
and, above all, his mind absolutely cowered at the
thought of his sister’s bitter wrath. So he buried his
secret within his own bosom, and trusting to some
future chance to rescue him from the irksome duties
of his profession, prepared himself for the ceremony
of ordination. But he was not yet sensible of the
terrible power of Conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day came, and, as usual, crowds were assembled
to witness the dedication of the youthful candidates.
The two young men—for Alfred had a
companion, a pious, humble-minded, meek-hearted
youth—stood before the altar to offer their vows.
Madeline, the weeping but happy Madeline—who
had sacrificed her youth and health and beauty, aye
and the hopes ever dearest to a woman’s heart, to
this one darling hope—was there too, and as she
looked on her brother bending before the altar, while
his bright curls just caught one straggling sunbeam
which shed a glory around his youthful brow, she
was heard to murmur “Lo, here am I, Lord, and the
child which thou hast given me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The services commenced—the prayers of the congregation
had arisen to Heaven, the incense of praise
had floated upward on the solemn melody of the
organ, the exhortation to the candidates had been
affectionately uttered by an aged pastor, and the
moment came when the presentation of the two was
made to the Bishop by the officiating clergyman.
The solemn appeal was then uttered⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Brethren, if there be any of you who knoweth
any impediment or any notable crime on either of
these persons for the which he ought not to be admitted
to the holy office, let him come forth in the
name of God and show what the crime or impediment
is.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At these words a sudden terror seemed to seize
upon Alfred Graham. His frame shook with suppressed
emotion, his countenance became livid, and
his fine features were strangely contorted as if some
sudden pang had convulsed him. The next instant
he uttered a faint cry and fell prostrate to the ground,
while his very life-blood was poured at the foot of
the altar which he had dared to touch with polluted
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was borne to his home in utter insensibility.
The sting of conscience had finished the work which
disease had long since begun, and the rupture of a
blood-vessel in the lungs had been the consequence
of his unnatural excitement and self-command. All
that medical skill could effect was tried, but without
success, and ere the lapse of another day it was
known that Alfred Graham was sinking into the arms
of death. There was no time for repentance—no
time to combat prejudices and awaken better impulses.
He lay as if in the deep torpor of insensibility,
until aroused by some cordial administered by
his physician, when his strength seemed to rally, and
raising himself on his pillow, he addressed his sister
in words which fell like molten lead upon her heart.
With all the eloquence of passion he poured forth a
wild confession of his errors and his doubts, and then,
in language equally fervid but far more bitter, he reproached
her—<span class='it'>her</span> who had devoted her whole life
to his welfare—as the cause of all his guilt. He accused
her of having crushed his timid spirit by sternness
and unbending rigor—of having taught him
hypocrisy by her fierce contempt for his weaknesses—of
having killed him by forcing him to a profession
which he hated and contemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not mad, Madeline,” he exclaimed, in a
hoarse voice, broken by his difficult and long-drawn
breath, “I am not mad, but so surely as I am now
stretched upon the bed of death, so surely has your
ambition and your mistaken zeal laid me here to die.
I seek not to excuse myself, and may God forgive me
my many secret sins; but never, never would my soul
have been so deeply stained had it not been for your
unrelenting indignation at my boyish follies, and
your determined will in the choice of my future destiny.
I forgive you, Madeline, but you will not forgive
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exertion of uttering these terrible words was
too great, and ere the sounds yet died upon the ear
of the horror-stricken sister, the spirit of the misguided
youth had gone to its dread account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that hour Madeline was utterly and entirely
changed. Whatever were her feelings she shared
them with none, but shrunk alike from question and
sympathy. Those dying reproaches, unjust as she
felt them to be, were yet engraven in ineffacable
characters upon her heart, and with a feeling akin to
the mistaken austerity which punishes the body for
the sins of the soul, she resolved to make her future
life a penance for her involuntary error. Lonely and
desolate, she took up her abode in a place well
suited to her embittered and almost misanthropic
feelings. For more than ten years the gray cottage
was her abode, and the labors of the seamstress furnished
her scanty subsistence. During all that period
not a creature was ever admitted beyond the threshold
of her door, and all curiosity about her had quite
subsided long before the termination of her lonely
career. At length she was missed from her usual
lowly seat in church. A second Sabbath came, and
still the black and veiled form of the recluse was not
seen. Common humanity demanded some inquiry
into her fate, and after several vain attempts to procure
admission into the cottage, the door was forced.
Upon a truss of straw, in one corner of the desolate
chamber, lay the emaciated form of the unfortunate
Madeline, stiff, and cold, and ghastly, as if days had
passed since the spirit had escaped from its clay tenement.
She died as she had lived, lonely, and unknown,
for it was not until years had elapsed that I
heard the story of the brother and the sister from the
lips of one who had known them in early days;
while other incidental circumstances enabled me to
identify Madeline Graham with the tall “<span class='it'>weird
woman</span>” who had so terrified my childish fancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The erring brother sleeps beneath the shadow of
the sanctuary, in ground still consecrated by holy
usage, but all trace of the hapless sister has vanished
from the earth. The village graveyard is now a
populous highway, bordered by tall houses and traversed
by busy feet, while the green hillock which
once marked the burial place of Madeline Graham
has long since been crushed beneath the weight of
pavements, echoing to the noisy tread of many a
thoughtless wayfarer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alas, for human love! and, alas, for human error!
How dreary and desolate would seem many a scene
of unmerited suffering did we not know that there is
a brighter world, where all tears shall be wiped from
all eyes, and where there shall be no sorrow nor
sighing through an eternity of happiness!</p>

<div><h1><a id='tro'></a>TROPICAL BIRDS.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY PARK BENJAMIN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beautiful are the Birds of the Tropics. Bright,
clear, sparkling, brilliant is their plumage. It is
steeped in “all the hues that gild the rainbow.” I
seek in vain for epithets by which to convey a
thought of their surpassing beauty. Had I, dear
reader, the pencil of Audubon, I might show you
what they are in repose; but repose does not display
their loveliness in its perfection. They are
most charming to behold when in motion—when
their many vivid colors contrast with the deep green
of the forests, in which they live and hold their
jocund revels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not many years ago, I passed a winter—or, I
might better say, the first months of the year—in the
Northern part of South America, where these birds
abound. There, was I often delighted by these
“exquisite, gay creatures of the element.” They
seemed to me like so many winged jewels, as they
glanced about in the rays of a dazzling sun. But let
me not indulge too much in fanciful allusions, lest
I should reluctantly enter upon the real purpose I
have in view in preparing this article: which is to
offer some account of Tropical Birds, so that the
reader may be attracted to the study of their Natural
History. It appears to me that our American
periodicals have too much of the <span class='it'>dulce</span> and too little
of the <span class='it'>utile</span>. It is well, sometimes, to mingle the
useful with the agreeable even in works of taste: I
may fail in my attempt to do so in this place, but
I shall at least deserve the credit of having made the
attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Doubtless many of my readers have in their possession
certain glass cases in which specimens of
birds with variegated plumage, having undergone
the art of the taxidermist, are arranged on artificial
trees or bushes as ornaments for the drawing room.
There are many persons in Guiana, who make it
their business to kill and prepare these birds, so that
they may adorn the halls of Natural History Societies
or private cabinets. Some birds, which fly about
the houses or plantations, are easily obtained; but
those, upon which most value is set, live in distant
wilds and woods, and are procured with great difficulty
and only by individuals long practised in the
art. Great caution must be observed in approaching,
and greater skill in shooting them; for they
must be slain so skilfully that their feathers shall not
be torn nor their color spoiled by an effusion of
blood from the wound. When one, who is unskilful,
tears or disfigures his birds, he makes up one specimen
out of two or more individuals of the same
species. Thus, upon a close examination, you may
often detect the wings of one bird joined to the body
of another, or, perhaps, an old head upon young
shoulders. But the worst piece of trickery, and one
which renders the specimen wholly valueless to an
ornithologist, is the altering of the natural color of
the bird by fire. I have seen many a brilliant specimen
exceedingly admired, which obtained a false
lustre in this manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There seems to be no limit to the wonderful varieties
of these birds. Every day brings to view some
new species, which outvies its compeers in the
grace of its form and the brilliancy of its plumage.
The adventurous bird-seeker will penetrate deeper
and deeper into the solitudes of those vast forests,
which, in primitive grandeur, lift up their leafy
columns and form umbrageous temples in the heart
of the Southern continent. Those lovely and still
unexplored domains are the probable haunts of thousands
and thousands of birds of dazzling beauty.
The clear beams of the sun, glinting through the
leaves of mighty trees, play among colors, as various
and as shifting as those of gems. No human
eye, save that of some Indian hunter who may
have lost his homeward way, has gazed upon these
strange, bright creatures; and the most fantastic
imagination may vainly endeavor to paint those tribes
of the air which have lived in their safe retreats, undisturbed
save by one another and the war of the
elements, since light first dawned upon creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the various little birds, black, yellow and
red, which may be observed in the midst of the
sugar canes and in the many trees of orange, mango
and lemon, there is a tribe, called <span class='sc'>Tyrants</span>, which
is very extensive. Great numbers are constantly
seen. They are about the size of our robin. One
species is called “the butcher bird,” and most
appropriately, since it pounces upon and slaughters
its prey with tyrannical cruelty. It is said to be of
service to the planter in destroying grubs and insects,
upon which it seizes in the manner of a hawk. It
first strikes its prey with its <span class='it'>bill</span> (like a dun) and
then grasps it in its claws so instantaneously afterward,
that the most acute observation alone can
enable one to decide on the priority of the action.
Its bill is of moderate length (unlike a tailor’s) compressed
and sharp. Its head is black and all its body
is white, save the outer feathers of the wings and
tail, which are black. This family of “Tyrants,”
of which the butcher bird is an influential member,
has very extensive connections; but as they are distinguished
neither for beauty nor behavior (“handsome
is that handsome does”) and can be very easily
“got round,” no great consequence is attached to
their possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next most numerous tribe is one whose
habits and characteristics are widely dissimilar—the
<span class='sc'>Parrots</span>. These exhibit plumage of the most diversified
hues; but the predominating is bright green. This
is often set off and contrasted by black, lilac, pink,
orange, violet and blue. It is impossible to tell how
many species have been discovered; for our traveller
refers the specimen which he has obtained to some
former description, and then points out the differences.
“This,” says one, “is the <span class='it'>blue</span> parrot; our
specimens, however, are bright <span class='it'>lilac</span>, with <span class='it'>red</span> spots
on the back, between the wings”—a remark which,
were it made by a native of the Emerald Isle, would
be called a bull; but the fact, nevertheless, may be
as true as the somewhat notorious one that “black-berries
are red when they are green.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parrots are of all sizes from the macaw or
ava, down to the smallest paroket. The common
green parrot, which is known in the United States,
and taught to speak, is of the medium size. The best
and clearest whistle is uttered by the homely brown
parrot, which is brought from Africa. It is likewise
the most docile. These birds resemble humanity in
other respects besides the faculty of speech; some
are hopelessly stupid, while others take to learning
very kindly. Curious stories are told of their powers
of articulation. The smallest kind, which cannot
live in our climate, are sometimes very successfully
educated. The manager of a plantation, which I
visited, owned a little parrot, which used to reside
in a cage at the door of his house. As I rode up, I
was agreeably astonished by hearing the polite bird
very considerately sing out, “Boy, take the gentleman’s
horse—boy, why the deuse don’t you take the
horse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The largest kind is the macaw. It is a huge,
clumsy <span class='it'>thing</span>, with a head out of all proportion to its
body, (“great head, little wit;”) its plumage is for
the most part red, interspersed with green and blue.
The noise which it makes is most horribly discordant;
and its loudest yell is very like an Indian war-whoop,
(one of Mr. Cooper’s;) yet is this monster a great
favorite in the West Indies, and, as you pass the
residences of the inhabitants, you often see three or
four of these ugly wretches clambering awkwardly
up the piazzas, and uttering their hoarse, scolding
cries, ten times more grating to the ear than the objurgations
of a Xantippe, heard above the shrieks of
her castigated offspring. The hardihood of these
birds is surprising. There was one of them on board
of a small vessel, in which it was my ill fortune to
voyage from the mainland to the island of Barbadoes.
Mr. Macaw, like a militia major in red and blue
uniform, would strut about on the lower rigging, and,
as soon as he could get near enough to the ear of a
sailor, would utter one of his shrillest and most appalling
yells. Jack Tar, in his summary method of
dealing vengeance, would fetch him a blow with a
handspike, that would send him flapping to the
quarter-deck; perhaps, with an utter disregard of
decorum and discipline, into the very face and eyes
of the surly old captain, who, in his rage, would beat
him soundly; yet would the valiant and stalwart
feathered marine regard those lusty strokes no more
than would a pet goldfinch the taps of his lady’s fan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some species of parrots exist in almost every region;
the smallest and most beautiful, however, are
found only in tropical countries. They are seldom
seen near thickly populated places, but can be procured
with facility in the woods adjacent, where
they live in tolerable fellowship with their mischievous
neighbors, the monkeys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another numerous tribe of tropical birds is known
by the name of <span class='sc'>Chatterers</span>. I do not know what
they are called by the ornithologists; but thus are
they designated by the inhabitants, from the peculiar
sounds which they utter, (being not unlike those of a
congress of spinsters, sitting in committee of the
whole on some grand question of scandal.) They
are distinguished by the epithets—red-breasted, purple-throated,
firebirds, pumpadore, red-headed, gold-headed,
white-throated, white-capped, purple-shouldered,
and Mahometan. The first five migrate; the
last five stay at home. Of the former, the firebird is
so named from the fact that, in stuffed specimens,
the color is sometimes changed by the application of
fire. Its natural hue is a dark crimson, but it is susceptible
of being changed, by the application of heat,
into a rich vermilion. Of the latter, the purple-shouldered
is the most rare and the most beautiful.
The upper parts of its wings or shoulders are the
deepest purple; the remainder of the wings is interspersed
with blue, and they end in black. Its back
is blue mingled with black; its breast is a delicate
blue, and the lower part of its neck is a dark crimson.
I describe the male bird only; for (unlike
bipeds <span class='it'>without</span> feathers) it monopolises the beauty of
the species. The female is very plain, though there
seems to be a certain winning modesty about her,
for all her homely looks. The sumptuously attired
male, (“Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed
like one of these,”) if his choice of a partner were
left to himself—which I doubt—must have been
guided by a taste as unsophisticated as that of the
praiseworthy Cock-Robin, when he courted Jenny
Wren, who</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>While on the subject of homeliness, I may as well
conclude it by alluding to a bird, which, on account
of its hideousness, the negroes call “Old Witch.”
What a very mortifying circumstance it must be to
be so ugly, when every body else is so bewitchingly
fair! Don’t you think so, Miss Smith? (I do not
mean the Miss Smith, who is reading this article,
but another.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before passing to an account of the third and last
family, which I shall try to describe—being by far
the most numerous, the strangest, and the most
charming of all the tropical birds—I will detain the
reader for a moment with an account of two rare
species of water birds. They are in general so
classed, because, like rails, they frequent reedy
ponds and marshes and the borders of streams. I
select these two species, because the one is very
curious and the other is of a kind with which classical
associations are connected, and because they
admirably serve to show how wide and fertile a field
of interesting investigation lies before the student in
this particular realm of Natural History.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curious species is the Jacana. It is doubtful
whether it should be classed with land or water
birds; it resembles the latter in its nature, its habits,
the form of its body, the shape of its bill, and the
diminutiveness of its head; it differs essentially, however,
from all others of the class, in the curious spurs
which protrude from its wings; its claws are very
long and slender, and its nails very pointed and
sharp—hence has been derived its name, “The Surgeon.”
It is exceedingly wild and can be caught
only by stratagem. These birds are of various colors:
some dark, tinged with violet; some green;
some black; some dusky red. Their flight is very
rapid, and their cry sharp and shrill. They travel
in pairs, frequenting the borders of rivers and
deep marshes. That which is particularly singular
about the Jacana is the manner in which it is armed;
when it strikes with its wings, it must do considerable
execution; it does not seem to be happily called
the Surgeon, for its instruments are rather intended
to kill than cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The classical species is called by moderns, “the
Sultana Hen.” It is the smallest of that genus, which
was named by the ancients Porphyry—in Greek,
Πορφυριωι—in Latin, <span class='it'>Porphyrio</span>. Aristotle describes
it as a fissiped bird, with long feet, a blue plumage,
with a very strongly set, purple-colored bill, and of
about the size of a domestic cock. Some old writers,
in describing this bird, have said that one of its feet
was furnished with membranes, and made to swim
like a water-bird’s, and that the other was fissiped,
so that it might run like a land-bird. This is not
only untrue, but contrary to nature, and signifies no
more than that the porphyry or pelican is a bird of
the shore, living on the confines of land and water.
It was easily tamed, and was very pleasing on account
of its noble carriage, its fine form, its plumage
brilliant and rich in colors of mingled blue and purple
and aquamarine, its docile nature, and its happy facility
of agreeing with any companions among whom
its lot might be cast. It was held in the highest
esteem by both Greeks and Romans; they never
suffered it to be eaten; they sent to Lybia for it;
always treated it with kindness, and placed it in their
palaces and temples, as worthy to dwell there on
account of the nobleness of its port, the sweetness
of its temper, and the beauty of its plumage. The
largest of the species, now known as “the sultana
hen,” is precisely the same as the ancient porphyrio.
The smallest is called “the little sultana hen.” Her
<span class='it'>petite</span> majesty is very queenly, but is, no doubt, as
well satisfied with the modern name by which she is
dignified, as she would be with that which the Greeks
gave to the tall highnesses of her very old and royal
family. Her robe of state is a brilliant changeable
blue and green; and it has never gone out of fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having thus given an unsystemized and rather imperfect
account of a few species of tropical birds, I
pass on to treat of the most marvellous and most
beautiful tribe of plumed creatures that float in the
invisible atmosphere. There have been more than
a hundred species already discovered, and every naturalist,
who visits the equatorial regions of this
Western World, adds a new name to the splendid
schedule of <span style='font-size:smaller'>HUMMING-BIRDS</span>.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> From their delicate
structure, these tiny birds cannot endure the rigors
of our climate, where there are very few of those
gorgeous plants, upon which they banquet in tropical
latitudes. There, when the warm sun calls into life
myriads of flowers, vast numbers of humming-birds
visit the fields and gardens every morning, and mingle
their golden-green tints in gleaming contrast with
the white and rose-colored blossoms, that cluster on
the vines above the traveller’s head, or spring luxuriantly
at his feet. They seem, as they dart rapidly
around, humming their faintly heard tunes, to be the
very Pucks and Ariels of the light, and each night
take up the burden of the fairy song, sung at the
feast of Titania,</p>

<p class='noindent'>But alas! however elfin-like and ethereal their forms
appear, they share the fate of mortals. They are
easily caught by nets thrown over them, or killed by
very fine shot or sand. I have seen some very
splendid collections. I remember one, comprising
seventy-two species—from the king of the humming-birds,
as he is called, with his topaz and emerald
crown, to one so small that, when on the wing, it
could scarcely be visible. When the glass case, in
which they were arranged in too studied an order,
was held in the sunshine, their myriad colors would
gleam and flash with a brilliancy as perfect as that of
the many gems, after which they are prettily named.
An enumeration of some of their names will convey
an idea of their appearance—sapphire-throated,
ruby-throated, sapphire and emerald, amethystine,
topaz-throated; then there are the purple, tri-colored,
violet-tufted, violet-crowned, blue-fronted, the superb,
the magnificent, the sabre-winged. And there
is one which must have been bestowed by some
ornithological phrenologist, who had great skill in
interpreting “the natural language” of birds—the
supercilious humming-bird. The largest species yet
discovered is that which is called the gigantic, and
the smallest, as I believe, is one that Sir William
Jardine describes as Gould’s humming-bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gigantic is in remarkable contrast to the rest
of his tribe, both in size and in the color of his plumage.
He is not only the largest but the homeliest,
while the smallest is the most beautiful. The gigantic
(the monster!) is nearly eight inches in length;
the crown, the back, the under and lesser wing-coverts,
brownish green, with reflections of green
tint; the under parts, light reddish mingled with a
deeper tint and shaded off with green; the feathers
are generally darker at the base, and the paler tips
give a slightly waved appearance to the breast. On
the throat, the feathers, though without lustre, retain
the scaly form and texture of the more brilliant species.
The wings slightly exceed the tail in length,
bend up at the tips, and exhibit the form of the most
correctly framed organ of flight; they are of a uniform
brownish violet. The tail is composed of ten
feathers, of a brownish color, and with golden-green
reflections; they gradually decrease in length. This
is a very rare species.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gould’s is the smallest species and of the most
dazzling beauty. It is scarcely over two inches in
length; its forehead, throat and upper part of its
breast are of a most brilliant green—the feathers of a
scaly form. From the crown springs a crest of bright,
chestnut feathers, of a lengthened form and capable
of being raised at pleasure. The back is a golden-green,
crossed with a whitish band; the wings and
tail are brownish purple, the latter having the centre
feathers tinged with green; the lower parts are dark
brownish green. The neck tufts are of the most
splendid kind, and have a chaste but brilliant effect;
they are composed of narrow feathers of a snowy
whiteness—the tips of each having a round, serrated
spot of bright emerald green, surrounded with a dark
border; the largest are at the upper part of the tuft,
and they decrease in length, assuming the shape of a
butterfly’s wing; shorter feathers again spring from
the base, and their green tips are relieved on the
white of the longer ones behind them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most common species, and that which abounds
in all parts of the West Indies, is the ruby-crested.
Though seen every day about the gardens, near the
honeysuckle and other flowering vines, it presents
some of the most splendid coloring of the family.
(Those which I have mentioned are of that sub-genus,
which Linnæus calls trochilus.) The upper
parts of the head and throat are clothed entirely with
those scaly formed feathers, which always produce
the parts producing the changeable hues. On the
hind head, the feathers are elongated and form a
short, rounded crest. In one position this part appears
of a deep, sombre, reddish brown; when
viewed transversely it assumes a bright, coppery
lustre, and when looked upon directly with a side
stream of light, it becomes of the richest and most
brilliant ruby. The scaly part of the throat and
breast again, when wanting the lustre, is of an
equally sombre, greenish brown; and, when turned
to diverse lights, changes from a clear golden-green
to the most brilliant topaz. It is impossible to convey
by words—especially as it is necessary to repeat
the same again and again—an idea of these tints.
The most that can be done is to name those substances,
which they most nearly resemble, then
rely upon the imagination of the reader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The birds, thus attempted to be described, are a
few of that multitudinous tribe which excites the
liveliest wonder, and fills the mind with admiration
of that creative power, which clothes the eagle with
strength to resist the fury of the mountain storm, and
so fashions the delicate plumage of the humming-bird
that the softest air from heaven seems to visit it
too roughly. The vine-clad forests and rose-covered
gardens of Guiana literally <span class='it'>swarm</span> with these fairy-birds.
The Indian word, by which they are distinguished,
signifies <span class='it'>beams</span> or <span class='it'>locks of the sun</span>; that
such a designation is not less appropriate than poetical,
may be concluded by all who have seen them
darting with the rapidity as well as the splendor of
light from flower to flower. Compared to the humming-bird,
the bee is a mere loiterer. He poises
himself on wing, while he thrusts his long, slender
tube into the flower-cups in search of food. But he
subsists not simply on honey-dew and the nectar that
dwells in the lips of roses. He may often be observed
darting at the minute insects that float in
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Audubon thus beautifully describes the humming-bird
in quest of food: “carefully visiting every
opening flower-cup, and, like a curious florist, removing
from each those injurious insects, that otherwise
would ere long cause their beauteous petals to
droop and decay. Poised in the air, it is observed
peeping cautiously and with sparkling eye into their
innermost recesses, whilst the ethereal motions of its
pinions, so rapid and so light, appear to fan and cool
the flower, without injuring its fragile texture, and
produce a delightful, murmuring sound, well adapted
for lulling the insects to repose. Then is the moment
for the humming-bird to secure them. Its long delicate
bill enters the cup of a flower, and the protruded,
double-tubed tongue, delicately sensible, and
imbued with a glutinous saliva, touches each insect
in succession, and draws it from its lurking place to
be instantly swallowed. All this is done in a moment,
and the bird, as it leaves the flower, sips so
small a portion of its liquid honey, that the theft, we
may suppose, is looked upon with a grateful feeling
by the flower which is thus kindly relieved from the
attacks of her destroyers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their favorite places of resort were those woods,
in which the superb bignonia abounds, and when the
huge trees are garlanded with parasites; but since
the cultivation of the country they frequent gardens
and seem to delight in society, becoming familiar
and destitute of fear, hovering over one side of a
shrub while the fruit or flower is plucked from that
opposite. They do not alight on the ground, but
easily settle on twigs and branches, when they move
sidewise in prettily measured steps, frequently opening
and closing their wings, shaking and arranging
the whole of their apparel with neatness and activity.
They are particularly fond of spreading one wing
at a time, and passing each of their quill-feathers
through their bills in its whole length, when, if the
sun is shining, the wing thus plumed is very transparent
and light. The humming noise proceeds
entirely from the surprising velocity with which
they perform that motion by which they will keep
their bodies in the air, apparently motionless, for
hours together. When flying to any long distance,
the manner of their flight is very different from that
shown in speeding among flowers, for they sweep
gracefully through the air in long undulations, raise
themselves for some distance and then fall in a curve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange as it may seem, one of the chief characteristics
of this tiny creature, is its bravery. It
will unhesitatingly attack the mocking-bird, or the
king-bird, or any other by whom it imagines its territories
invaded; it directs its sharp, needle-like bill,
immediately at the eyes of its enemy, and when so
employed this must be a truly formidable weapon.
These birds are also extremely pugnacious among
themselves—two males seldom meeting, without a
battle. The combatants ascend in the air, chirping,
darting and circling round each other till the eye is
no longer able to follow them. They are particularly
susceptible of jealousy, and, under the influence
of this failing, they run tilts at each other till the less
doughty champion falls exhausted to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nests of these little creatures are very curious;
they are built with great delicacy, but at the same time
with much compactness and warmth. Wilson says
that the nest of the ruby-throated humming-bird is generally
fixed on the upper side of a horizontal branch,
<span class='it'>not</span> among the twigs. It is sometimes, however,
attached to an old moss-grown trunk, and sometimes
fastened on a strong stalk or weed in the garden. It
seldom builds more than ten feet from the ground.
The nest is about an inch in diameter and as much in
depth. The outward coat is formed of small pieces
of a species of bluish-gray lichen, that vegetates on
old trees and fences, thickly glued with the saliva of
the bird, giving firmness and consistency to the whole
as well as keeping out moisture. Within this are
thick, matted layers of the fine wings of certain flying
seeds, closely laid together; and, lastly, the downy
substance from the great mullein, and from the stalks
of the common fern, lines the whole. The base of
the nest is continued round the stem of the branch to
which it closely adheres, and, when viewed from
below, appears a mere mossy knot or accidental protuberance.
The nest of one species in Guiana is
principally composed of a spongy cellular substance,
apparently similar to that of a fungus, of which some
kinds of wasps build large habitations, suspended
from the branches of trees, and an account is given
of a nest of another species composed entirely of the
down of some thistle; the seed is attached and is
placed outwards, giving a jagged and prickly appearance
to the outside. Latham describes the nest
of the black humming-bird as made of cotton, entwined
around the thorns and twigs of the citron-tree,
and of so firm a texture as not to be easily
broken by winds. The nest of the topaz-crested
is about seven eighths of an inch in diameter, also
made of cotton, stuck over with lichens on the outside
and firmly fixed in the hanging cleft of some
strong creeper by threads of a cottony substance,
and very slender roots or tendrils, the whole lower
part as if cemented by a thin coat of glue. It is
probable that the greater number build their nests
nearly in the same manner. Descriptions, however,
are given of those built in different forms—one is
suspended with the entrance downwards; another is
of a lengthened form, composed of dry grass and
slender roots and moss, and is not made so compactly.
A person, who saw a bird building her nest,
describes her manner of construction as very ingenious.
“Bringing a pile of small grass, she commenced
upon a little twig about a quarter of an inch
in diameter, immediately below a large leaf, which
entirely covered and concealed the nest from above,
the height from the ground being about three feet.
After the nest had received two or three of these
grasses, she set herself in the centre, and putting her
long slender beak over the outer edge, seemed to use
it and her throat much in the same way as a mason
does his trowel, for the purpose of smoothing, rubbing
it to and fro and sweeping quite around. Each
visit to the nest seemed to occupy only a couple of
seconds, and her absence from it not more than as
many minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extraordinary beauty of these strange beings
has induced many attempts to tame and keep them
in cages, but they have not been successful. When
placed in cages and fed daintily on honey and water,
and supplied every morning with fresh cups of flowers,
they have been known to live for a long time in
their native country, and in warm weather; but no
artificial warmth has as yet kept them alive for
many weeks, when transported to a less genial
climate. It is conjectured, however, that with very
great care and a strict regard to diet, as the doctors
say, they will, by and by, be kept alive and happy
in our conservatories. There was once a nest of
them successfully carried to England from Jamaica.
It was presented to a lady, from whose lips the little
loves would deign to accept honey. One died, probably
from excess of happiness; but the other, being
more hardy, survived for two months. Could a lady
succeed in so taming one of these winged jewels so
perfectly that it would accompany her to a ball,
curiously perched upon her bouquet, or hovering
around the flowers which composed it, at her gentle
bidding, so original an ornament would doubtless be
more highly prized than</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Whole necklaces and stomachers of gems.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The ancient Mexicans are said to have woven their
plumage into gorgeous robes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the extraordinary beauty of these birds, their
mode of existence, their nature, then habits, excite
our admiration, how must we also wonder at their
structure!—the perfect adaptation of their forms to
that life which it is theirs to enjoy, and to the variations
of that glowing climate where they abound.
“On presenting a humming-bird to a common observer,”
says an eminent naturalist, “the first exclamation
generally is, ‘what a beautiful little creature!’—the
second, ‘but what large wings he has!’
Such, indeed, is the case, and, in most instances, the
size of the wings and strength of the quills are entirely
out of proportion to our ideas of symmetry in
a creature clothed with feathers; but, upon comparing
them with its necessities and the other parts
of its frame, their utility and design become obvious.”
The principal reason for their possessing organs of
such power is, doubtless, to enable them to pass in
safety through the migrations and the long flights
which are necessary for their preservation, and,
during which, they have to withstand passing gales
and showers. The delicious climes which they inhabit
are at seasons subject to tremendous rains,
which drench and almost inundate their abodes, or
to hurricanes that, in a few minutes, leave but a
wreck of all that was before so splendid and luxuriant.
By means of these organs, before the dangerous
season comes, which the unerring instinct of
nature warns them to avoid, they fly to districts of
country where the reparation of some previous
wreck is proceeding with all the rapidity of tropical
vegetation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot more pleasingly conclude these notices of
the most wonderful tribe of birds, than by quoting
the melodious verses of a poet, who is a native of
that glowing clime which they so exquisitely adorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have thus given partial descriptions of four of
the principal tribes of Tropical Birds. I hope the
reader has not been so wearied that he will not
kindly suffer me to draw this article to a close by a
brief notice of those two birds most remarkable for
their peculiar notes. The one pours forth a stream
of rich melody, which surpasses the far-famed song
of the nightingale, and is, likewise, celebrated for
its peculiar power of imitating the tones of almost
every fellow-songster. The other utters only one
sound, but so strange and solemn as to inspire the
mind of the hearer with a religious awe. The natural
music of the one is as gay, cheerful and enlivening
as that of the other is mournful and soul-subduing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first to which I allude is the Matthews of the
woods, <span style='font-size:smaller'>THE MOCKING-BIRD</span>. This species abound in
all parts of the Western Indies; they are found in
great numbers near the sea-shore. From the trees
which grow on the beaches float their rich songs,
more melodious than strains of flute, or bugle, or
any “cunningly devised instrument;” and, in mellowness,
in modulation and gradation, in extent of
compass and rapidity and brilliancy of execution,
outrivalling the most magnificent bravuras of a Sontag
or a Malibran. When confined in cages and
brought to our cold climate, for the amusement of
man, the bird loses, in the loneliness of its captivity,
half the richness of its voice. Though it delights to
mimic other plumed minstrels, this astonishing faculty
is feeble, in its most miraculous exhibition, when
compared with its own delicious song; but he who
would listen to it in its perfection, must go to those
regions where the great magnolia shoots up its majestic
trunk, covered with evergreen leaves, and decorated
with a thousand flowers, where the forests
and fields are buried in blossoms of every hue, and
where the golden orange decorates the gardens and
the groves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bird whose note is so melancholy is called by
the Indians campanero; by the Spaniards arapongo
or guirapongo, and by the English the bell-bird. It is
extremely rare. I was so fortunate as to see a single
specimen. It is of about the size of a Barbary dove,
but more gracefully shaped, with a larger head. It
is of a snowy whiteness. From the forehead there
rises a spiral tube of about a bodkin’s length. This
tube, it is said, is raised and depressed at pleasure;
it is black, dotted with white feathers, and, as it is
hollow, and communicates with the palate, it is
probably elevated when filled with air, and becomes
pendulous when empty. That strange sound, for
which it is remarkable, is probably produced by the
raising and depressing of this tube. It resembles
the tolling of a bell, and is very loud and distinct.
It is heard morning and evening in the woods, and
one might fancy its toll to proceed from some hidden
convent, calling to matins and vespers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell-bird is seldom found in forests inhabited
by other birds; it selects lonely and desolate haunts.
A recent traveller, in describing his journey through
a South American forest, writes—“Nothing can be
more still and solitary than everything around; the
silence is appalling and the desolation is awful;
neither are disturbed by the sight or voice of living
thing, save one—which only adds to the impression.
It is like the clinking of metals, as if two lumps of
brass were struck together; and it sometimes resembles
the distant and solemn tolling of a church-bell,
struck at long intervals. This extraordinary sound
proceeds from a bird called arapongo or guirapongo.
It is about the size of a small pigeon, white, with a
circle of red round the eyes. It sits on the tops of
the highest trees, and in the deepest forests, and,
though constantly heard in the most desert places, is
very rarely seen. It is impossible to conceive any
thing of a more solitary character than the profound
silence of the woods, broken only by the metallic
and almost preternatural sounds of this invisible bird,
coming from the air, and seeming to follow you
wherever you go. I have watched with greet perseverance,
when the sound seemed quite close to me,
and never but once caught a glance of the cause. It
passed suddenly over the top of a very high tree, like a
large flake of snow, and immediately disappeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lower counties of New Jersey are proverbially
barren, being covered with immense forests of
pine, interspersed with cedar swamps. During the
dry summer months these latter become parched to
an extent that is incredible, and the accidental contagion
of a fire-brand often wraps immense tracts of
country in flames. The rapidity with which the
conflagration, when once kindled, spreads through
these swamps can scarcely be credited except by
those who know how thoroughly the moss and twigs
are dried up by the heat of an August sun. Indeed
scarcely a spot can be pointed out in West Jersey,
which has not, at one time or another, been ravaged
by conflagration. It was but a few years since that
an immense tract of these pine barrens was on fire,
and the citizens of Philadelphia can recollect the
lurid appearance of the sky at night, seen at the distance
of thirty or even forty miles from the scene of
the conflagration. The legendary history of these
wild counties is full of daring deeds and hair-breadth
escapes which have been witnessed during such
times of peril. One of these traditionary stories it is
our purpose to relate. The period of our tale dates
far back into the early history of the sister state,
when the country was even more thinly settled than
at present.</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&ensp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It was a sunny morning in midsummer, when a
gay party was assembled at the door of a neat house
in one of the lower counties of New Jersey. Foremost
in the group stood a tall manly youth, whose
frank countenance at once attracted the eye. By his
side was a bright young creature, apparently about
eighteen years of age, whose golden tresses were a
fit type of the sunny beauty of her countenance. But
now her soft blue eyes were dim with tears, and
she leaned on the shoulder of her mother, who was
apparently equally affected. The dress of the daughter,
and her attitude of leave-taking, told that she was a
bride, going forth from the home of her childhood,
to enter on a new and untried sphere of life. The
other members of the group were composed of her
father, her brothers and sisters, and the bridemen
and bridemaids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, my daughter, and have you in his
holy keeping,” said the father as he gave her his last
embrace, “and now farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last kiss was given, the last parting word was
said, the last long look had been taken, and now the
bridal party was being whirled through the forest
on one of the sweetest mornings of the sweet month
of July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was indeed a lovely day. Their way lay through
an old road which was so rarely travelled that it
had became overgrown with grass, among which the
thick dew-drops, glittering in the morning sun, were
scattered like jewels on a monarch’s mantle. The
birds sang merrily in the trees, or skipped gaily from
branch to branch, while the gentle sighing of the
wind, and the occasional murmur of a brook crossing
the road, added to the exhilirating influences of
the hour. The travellers were all young and happy,
and so they gradually forgot the sadness of the parting
hour, and ere they had traversed many miles the
green arcades of that lovely old forest were ringing
with merry laughter. Suddenly, however, the bride
paused in her innocent mirth, and while a shade of
paleness overspread her cheek, called the attention
of her husband to a dark black cloud, far off on the
horizon, and yet gloomier and denser than the darkest
thunder cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The forest is on fire!” was his instant ejaculation,
“think you not so, Charnley?” and he turned
to his groomsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! but the wind is not towards us, and the fire
must be miles from our course. There is no need
for alarm, Ellen,” said he, turning to the bride, his
sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But our road lies altogether through the forest,”
she timidly rejoined, “and you know there isn’t a
house or cleared space for miles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! but my dear sis, so long as the fire keeps
its distance, it matters not whether our road is
through the forest or the fields. We will drive on
briskly and before noon you will laugh at your fears.
Your parting from home has weakened your nerves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No more was said, and for some time the carriage
proceeded in silence. Meantime the conflagration
was evidently spreading with great rapidity. The
dark, dense clouds of smoke, which had at first been
seen hanging only in one spot, had now extended in
a line along the horizon, gradually edging around so
as to head off the travellers. But this was done so imperceptibly
that, for a long time, the travellers were not
aware of it, and they had journeyed at least half
an hour before they saw their danger. At length the
bride spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely, dear Edward,” she said, addressing her
husband, “the fire is sweeping around ahead of us:
I have been watching it by yonder blasted pine, and
can see it slowly creeping across the trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every eye was instantly turned in the direction in
which she pointed, and her brother, who was driving,
involuntarily checked the horses. A look of dismay
was on each countenance as they saw the words of
the bride verified. There could be no doubt that the
fire had materially changed its bearing since they
last spoke, and now threatened to cut off their escape
altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish, Ellen, we had listened to your fears and
turned back half an hour ago:” said the brother,
“we had better do it at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help us—that is impossible,” said the husband,
looking backwards, “the fire has cut off our
retreat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as he said. The flames, which at first had
started at a point several miles distant and at right
angles to the road the party was travelling, had
spread out in every direction, and finding the swamp
in the rear of the travellers parched almost to tinder
by the draught, had extended with inconceivable
velocity in that quarter, so that a dense cloud of
smoke, beneath which a dark lurid veil of fire
surged and rolled, completely cut off any retrograde
movement on the part of the travellers. This volume
of flame, moreover, was evidently moving
rapidly in pursuit. The cheeks, even of the male
members of the bridal party, turned ashy pale at the
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to do but to push on,” said the
brother, “we will yet clear the road before the fire
reaches it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I remember,” said the husband, “there is
a road branching off to the right, scarce half a mile
ahead: we can gain that easily, when we shall be
safe. Cheer up, Ellen, there is no danger. This is
our wedding morn, let me not see you sad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horses were now urged forward at a brisk
pace, and in a few minutes the bridal party reached
the cross road. Their progress was now directly from
the fire; all peril seemed at an end; and the spirits
of the group rose in proportion to their late depression.
Once more the merry laugh was heard, and
the song rose up gaily on the morning air. The conflagration
still raged behind, but at a distance that
placed all fear at defiance, while in front the fire,
although edging down towards them, approached at
a pace so slow that they knew it would not reach the
road until perhaps hours after they had attained their
journey’s end. At length the party subsided again
into silence, occupying themselves in gazing on the
magnificent spectacle presented by the lurid flames,
as, rolling their huge volumes of smoke above them,
they roared down towards the travellers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The forest is as dry as powder,” said the husband,
“I never saw a conflagration travel so rapidly.
The fire cannot have been kindled many hours, and
it has already spread for miles. Little did you think,
Ellen,” he said, turning fondly to his bride, “when
we started this morning, that you should so narrowly
escape such a peril.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, as I live, the peril is not yet over,” suddenly
exclaimed the brother, “see—see—a fire has
broke out on our right, and is coming down on to us
like a whirlwind. God have mercy on us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with an energy that would have startled
his hearers without the fearful words he uttered.
But when they followed the direction of his quivering
finger, a shriek burst from the two females,
while the usually collected husband turned ashy
pale, not for himself, but for her who was dearer to
him than his own life. A fire, during the last few
minutes, had started to life in the forest to their right,
and, as the wind was from that quarter, the flames
were seen ahead shooting down towards the road
which the bridal party was traversing, roaring, hissing,
and thundering as they drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drive faster—for heaven’s sake—on the gallop!”
exclaimed the husband, as he comprehended the
imminency of their danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brother made no answer, for he well knew
their fearful situation, but whipped the horses into
a run. The chaise flew along the narrow forest
road with a rapidity that neither of the party had
ever before witnessed; for even the animals themselves
seemed aware of their peril, and strained
every sinew to escape from the fiery death which
threatened them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their situation was indeed terrible, and momentarily
becoming more precarious. The fire, when
first seen, was, at least, a mile off, but nearly equidistant
from a point in the road the bridal party was
traversing; and, as the conflagration swept down
towards the road with a velocity equal to that of the
travellers, it soon became evident that they would
have barely time to pass the fire ere it swept across
the road, thus cutting off all escape. Each saw
this; but the females were now paralized with fear.
Only the husband spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faster, for God’s sake, faster,” he hoarsely cried,
“see you not that the fire is making for yonder tall
pine—we shall not be able to reach the tree first
unless we go faster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do my best,” said the brother, lashing still
more furiously the foaming horses. “Oh! God, that I
had turned back when Ellen wished me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On came the roaring fire—on in one mass of flame—on
with a velocity that seemed only equalled by
that of the flying hurricane. Now the flames caught
the lower limbs of a tall tree and in an instant had
hissed to its top—now they shot out their forky
tongues from one huge pine to another far across
the intermediate space—and now the whirling fire,
whistled along the dry grass and moss of the swamp
with a rapidity which the eye could scarcely follow.
Already the fierce heat of the conflagration began to
be felt by the travellers, while the horses, feeling the
increase of warmth, grew restive and terrified.
The peril momentarily increased. Hope grew fainter.
Behind and on either side the conflagration roared in
pursuit, while the advancing flame in front was cutting
off their only avenue of escape. <span class='it'>They were
girdled by fire.</span> Faster and quicker roared the
flames towards the devoted party, until at length
despair seized on the hearts of the travellers. Pale,
paralized, silent, inanimate as statues, sat the females;
while the husband and brother, leaning
forward in the carriage and urging the horses to
their utmost speed, gazed speechlessly on the approaching
flames. Already the fire was within a
hundred yards of the road ahead, and it seemed
beyond human probability that the travellers could
pass it in time. The husband gave one last agonizing
glance at his inanimate wife. When again he
looked at the approaching flames, he saw that during
that momentary glimpse they had lessened their
distance one half. He could already feel the hot
breath of the fire on his cheek. The wind, too, suddenly
whirled down with fiercer fury, and in an
instant the forky tongues of the advancing conflagration
had shot across the road, and entwined themselves
around the tall pine which had been the goal
of the travellers’ hopes. He sank back with a groan.
But the brother’s eye gleamed wildly at the sight,
and gathering the reins tighter around his hand, he
made one last desperate effort to force the horses
onward; and with one mad leap, they lifted the carriage
from the ground as if it had been a plaything,
plunged into the fiery furnace, and the next instant
had shot through the pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charnley gave one look backwards, as if to assure
himself that they had indeed escaped—he saw the
lurid mass of fire roaring and whirling across the
spot through which they had darted but a moment
before; and overcome with mingled gratitude and
awe, he lowered his head on his breast and poured
out an overflowing soul in thanksgivings to the Power
which had saved them from the most dreadful of
deaths. And long afterwards, men, who travelled
through that charred and blackened forest, pointed to
the memorable scene where these events occurred,
and rehearsed the thrilling feelings of those who had
been encompassed by <span class='sc'>the Girdle of Fire</span>.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Notes of a Tour through Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Arabia
Petræa, to the Holy Land; including a Visit to Athens,
Sparta, Delhi, Cairo, Thebes, Mount Sinai, Petræa, &amp;c.
By E. Joy Morris. Two vols. 12 mo. pp. 550. Philadelphia,
Carey &amp; Hart: 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Were we disposed to be hypercritical, we should begin
by finding some fault with the title of these volumes. It is
quite too long, besides being tautological. Why speak of
a tour through Egypt, and a visit to Thebes! Or of a tour
through Greece and a visit to Athens? It would be as
proper to announce a journey through England, including
a visit to London. He who travels over a country of
course visits its capital. If he supposes the readers of his
journal do not know what city enjoys that distinction, it is
even then better to let them acquire this geographical information
by degrees. Too great and sudden developments
may defeat his object; a man’s vision is sometimes obscured
by excess of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the improbabilities which are scattered throughout the
work we have space only to notice one or two. Mr. Morris
informs us that the <span class='it'>harem</span> of the Governor of Smyrna,
which he encountered on board a steamer, “consisted of
some half-dozen ladies, (wives,) and, with attendants,
amounted to near thirty persons.” Rather too many wives
for the simple Aga of Smyrna, and more than the Koran
allows. The holy book of the Mahommedan permits no
one, save the Grand Sultan—the representative of the prophet—to
have more than two; and that highest of dignitaries,
and hereditary favorite of the immortals, has but four.
The Governor of Smyrna, we are assured by a competent
authority, has but <span class='it'>one</span> wife, and she is of Turkish descent,
and not, as our author avers, a Circassian. Had she been
of Circassia she would have been a concubine, not a wife,
or, as the author blunderingly calls her, a <span class='it'>Sultana</span>. That
title belongs only to the favorite wife of the <span class='it'>Sultan</span>. Our
traveller tells us that he offered to this lady some sweet-meats,
although her husband and the keeper of his harem
were both present! An averment which we would be as
chary of believing as if it were that the “light” of the
Grand Seigneur’s palace had accepted an invitation to
swim with him in the Bosphorus!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Morris tells us that he found in the slave market of
Constantinople two beautiful Georgian girls, “destined for
the harems of the rich,” in <span class='it'>cages</span>, but that he was “only
indulged with a glance at them through the <span class='it'>bars</span>!” Now
a cage, or such a place as he intended to describe by that
word, even for the ugliest Numidian, would not be tolerated
in Constantinople for an hour; nor has there been
for many years a Georgian girl publicly exhibited in the
markets of that city. When a writer, sensible of the dulness
of his performance, seeks to impart to it some interest
by weaving into its chapters romantic fictions, he should
be careful to give them an air of probability. We have
not time nor inclination to point out other “attractions” in
these volumes of a similar description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While writing of Athens and Constantinople, Mr. Morris
doubtless had by his side Mr. Colton’s “Visit” to those
places; and in his notices of Arabia Petræa and Egypt he
has availed himself of the information acquired by Mr.
Stevens and Professor Robinson. He has made what, in
the language of the <span class='it'>trade</span>, is called a readable book;
but it possesses neither originality, vigor, nor freshness;
and his delineations, besides lacking these qualities, are
often tediously long and needlessly particular. He does
not pretend to give any new topographical information, and
his work contains none. It was probably written out from
slight notes taken during his tour, and the more elaborate
descriptions of other travellers. It evinces some taste and
judgment in the selection of themes, and is now and then
graced by a classical allusion or quotation, gleaned, perhaps,
from the guide-books, which make authorship so
easy to the tourist.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Punishment by Death: Its Authority and Expediency. By
Rev. George B. Chester. One vol. 12mo. pp. 156. New
York: M. W. Dodd.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Several able sermons on this important subject have
issued from the press. This is a more extended and elaborate
effort. It displays learning, research, and philosophical
acumen, and is worthy of general and serious attention.
We know of no treatise in our language, on this subject, so
well calculated for circulation among the people at large.
It is brief, clear, comprehensive, written in an interesting
style, and often rising to a strain of vivid and stirring eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About half the volume is devoted to the argument from
Scripture; in which the original Noahic ordinance is
taken as the ground-work, commented upon in the Mosaic
statutes, and confirmed in the New Testament. The writings
and experience of Paul are examined, and the course
of the Divine Providence is shown to be consentaneous
with this argument. The state of legislation and society
in the antediluvian world, as well as afterwards, are investigated,
with the origin of government, and the nature
of its sanction in the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remainder of the book is taken up with the argument
from Expediency. The question is examined, What constitutes
the perfection of criminal jurisprudence! The
efficacy of punishment by death in restraining crime is
argued, and also that the abrogation of this punishment
would prove a premium on the crime of murder, through
the desire of concealing other crimes. The law of nature
is examined, with the powerful convictions of conscience
on this subject, as sustaining the Divine legislation, and
demanding support also in human law. Various objections
are considered and answered, with the occasion of the prejudice
against Capital Punishment. The book concludes
with a chapter on the power and solemnity of the argument
from analogy, in reference to the sanctions of the Divine
Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An excellent work, in which most of what is really

Daubeny, has been condensed for the practical reader.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Tecumseh, or the West Thirty Years Since: A Poem: By
George H. Colton. 12mo. pp. 412. New York: Wiley &amp;
Putnam, 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We alluded to this work very briefly in a former number,
and now recur to it mainly for the purpose of presenting
some specimens of the author’s versification, by which the
reader may be enabled to judge of its general execution.
“Tecumseh” is a narrative, founded on the history of that
great chief whose name is chosen for its title, and whose
efforts to unite the various divisions of the red race into
one grand confederacy, to regain their lost inheritance,
though unsuccessful, should secure to him a fame as lasting
as is awarded to the most celebrated heroes and patriots of
the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The measure of the main part of the poem—extending to
nine long cantos—is octo-syllabic. It is free, and generally
correct, though in some cases marred by inexcusable carelessness,
and phraseology more tame and meaningless than,
had he kept his manuscript for a few years, the author
would have permitted to go before the critics. The hero,
with the wily prophet, Els-kwa-ta-wa, who was his evil
genius through life, is introduced in the second canto.

<p class='line0'>With conscious lustre, calm and still;</p>
<p class='line0'>By dell, and plain, and sloping hill</p>

<p class='line0'>As various as their clouded leaf.</p>
<p class='line0'>With all the hues of sunset skies</p>
<p class='line0'>Were stamp’d the maple’s mourning dies;</p>
<p class='line0'>In meeker sorrow in the vale</p>
<p class='line0'>The gentle ash was drooping pale;</p>
<p class='line0'>Brown-seared the walnut raised its head,</p>
<p class='line0'>The oak displayed a lifeless red;</p>
<p class='line0'>And grouping bass and white-wood hoar</p>
<p class='line0'>Sadly their yellow honors bore;</p>

<p class='line0'>But elm and stubborn beech retained</p>
<p class='line0'>Some verdant lines, though crossed and stained,</p>

<p class='line0'>While in the woods, by bank and stream</p>
<p class='line0'>And hollows shut from daylight gleam,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where tall trees wept their freshening dews,</p>
<p class='line0'>Each shrub preserved its summer hues.</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor this alone. From branch and trunk</p>
<p class='line0'>The withered wild-vines coldly shrunk,</p>
<p class='line0'>The woodland fruits hung ripe or dry,</p>

<p class='pindent'>From these passages the general character of the work
may be inferred. It is too long: it would be unwise to
extend a poem on any theme to nine cantos, of near fourteen
thousand lines; and besides its diffuseness, in parts,
it has other faults, to which we have already alluded. It
is the first production, however, of an author just freed
from the University; not yet, apparently, twenty-two
years old; and, so regarded, the severest critic must deem
it remarkably free from errors in design and execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some half dozen elaborate metrical tales, founded on
Indian histories or traditions, have before appeared in this
country, of which but one—the “Yamoyden” of Sands
and Eastburn—is comparable to this; and that is inferior
to it in unity, and, indeed, in almost all its essential features.
The admirable proem to “Yamoyden,” in which
Sands laments in such touching strains the early death of
his associate and friend, is not rightly considered a part of
the poem to which it is prefixed. To this Mr. Colton has
produced nothing equal; nor is he worthy <span class='it'>yet</span> to be ranked
with Sands as a poet. But “Tecumseh,” until some nobler
work is written, must be considered the best poem of its
class written by an American.</p>

The Present State and Future Prospects of those Countries.
By J. Harlan, late Counsellor of State, Aid-de-Camp,
and General of the Staff, to Dost Mahomed,
Ameer of Cabul. One vol. 12mo. Philadelphia: J.
Dobson, 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>General Harlan resided in India and Avghanistoun
eighteen years, and his official stations during that period
were such as he would have chosen had his principal
object been to form a correct judgment in regard to the
social and political conditions of those countries. The facts
and opinions contained in this work must therefore command
regard, especially since the recent military operations
in that quarter have drawn so much attention to the
British East Indian Empire. The volume comprises remarks
on the late massacre of the British Army in Cabul, and the
British policy in India; a reply to the Count Björstjerna’s
work on that country; the Russian influence in central
Asia; the foreign relations of the Indo-British government;
the moral, religious and political character and
condition of the Indians and Avghans; and the results of
missionary exertions and prospects of Christianity among
them; together with an interesting sketch of the history
and personal character of Dost Mahomed, one of the most
remarkable individuals that have appeared in the oriental
nations during this century. In an appendix, the author
indulges in some speculations on a passage in the Book of
Daniel, which he supposes has reference to the present
condition of the Mahommedan countries, and indicates the
speedy extinction of the Ottoman empire. The book is
illustrated with maps and a portrait of the Ex-Ameer of
Cabul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall look with some anxiety for General Harlan’s
“Personal Narrative of Eighteen Years’ Residence in
Asia,” which we believe is now in press.</p>

Wesleyan University. By Joseph Holdich. One vol. 8vo.
Pp. 455. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Wilbur Fisk was one of the purest and most useful men
of our time. With a temperament remarkably sanguine
and ardent, all his qualities were so subdued and harmonized
by religion, as to form one of the finest models of
elevated Christian character that has been presented to the
world. He was a native of Brattleborough, Vermont,
where he was born in 1792. In his early years he enjoyed
no advantages that are not within the reach of almost
every young man of New England. When about twenty-two
years of age he began to study the law, but soon after
turned his attention to the ministry, and in the spring of
1818 was licensed to preach by a Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church. In 1823 he was made a ruling
elder, and in 1825, principal of the Methodist Seminary of
Wilbraham. In 1829, he received the degree of Doctor in
Divinity, from Augusta College, and from Brown University,
and the following year was elected to the presidency
of the Wesleyan University at Middletown. In the
autumn of 1835, he visited Europe, and passed about a
year on the continent and in Great Britain. The record of
his travels, published soon after his return, has been one of
the most popular works of its kind written by an American.
He died at Middletown, after a long and painful illness,
borne with singular fortitude and resignation, on the
twenty-second of February, 1840. The Memoirs before
us, by his friend Professor Holdich, are written with ability
and candor; but the most interesting portions of the work
are Dr. Fisk’s admirable private letters, distinguished
alike for a beauty of style, simplicity, earnestness, and affection,
that indicates, better than any labored delineation by
another hand, his high character and endowments. <span class='it'>Philadelphia:

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is one of the many narratives of adventures at sea
given to the public in consequence of the success of Mr.
Dana’s “Two Years before the Mast.” The author, who
retired from the merchant service more than twenty years
ago, presents some interesting reminiscences of voyages to
India, South America, and other parts of the world, written
in a style of simple elegance rather unusual for a veteran
sailor. The industry and enterprise of the New Englanders
is in nothing more conspicuous than in their mercantile
marine, and we infer from his pleasant work, that Mr.
Cleveland has done his part to gain for them their enviable
reputation.</p>

Cleveland Coxe, Rector of St. Anna’s Chapel, Morrisania,

“Athanasion” is, perhaps, his best metrical composition.

Two vols. 12mo. Philadelphia: Lea &amp; Blanchard, 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Theodore Edward Hook was one of the most popular of
the authors who died in the last year. His table wit, it is
said, in freshness and exuberance, was never equalled in
England; and the humor that pervades his writings will
keep them in favor probably for centuries. The novel
before us was his last. It appeared originally by separate
chapters in the New Monthly Magazine, of which he
was editor; and he was engaged in its revision when
seized by the disease which terminated his career. His
first work—excepting some plays written in his boyhood—was
“Sayings and Doings,” published in 1824. It was
followed by a second and third series of the same work;
by “Maxwell,” “The Parson’s Daughter,” “Jack Brag,”
“Births, Deaths, and Marriages,” “Gilbert Gurney,”
“Gurney Married,” “Precepts and Practice,” several
volumes of biography, and “Fathers and Sons.” He died
on the twenty-second day of September, 1841, in the fifty-third
year of his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His last work has all his peculiarities; the most felicitous
humor; graphic delineations of character; and incidents
interesting and ingeniously diversified. We have
not space for an analysis of its plot; and one is the less
necessary, as, notwithstanding the “hardness of the
times,” very few will permit the last legacy of Theodore
Hook to go unread.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>John Summerfield was one of those remarkable men who
have appeared from time to time to electrify the religious

when but twenty years of age, and soon after came to
the United States, where he continued to labor as an
evangelist until his death, which occurred sixteen years
ago. Most of the sermons and sketches of sermons included
in the volume before us were written down after
their public delivery. They possess a deep interest, especially
to those who remember the sainted author, more

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A valuable elementary treatise on Geology. For the
convenience of those who have not access to cabinets of
minerals, the author has collected various chemical and
mineralogical details, to enable any person easily to
recognise the different minerals when discovered in the
fields. In the purely geological part of the work, Mr.
Trimmer has confined himself to facts and classifications
and a few universally admitted inferences, avoiding all
questions affecting the higher generalizations, since they
are still and must long continue to be matters of controversy.
The work is illustrated with wood-cuts. We commend it

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is an able and comprehensive work, and may be
consulted with confidence by persons who wish to inquire
concerning the history, scenery, antiquities, topography,
and present condition of Italy. The author is, perhaps,
less profound than he would have been if he had
contemplated a more voluminous treatise. For all purposes,
however, of general reference, or as a guide to
more detailed inquiries, his volumes may be consulted with
advantage. The account of the social, religious and political
revolutions of the ancient and modern Italians, and the
history of the rise and progress of the arts and literature in
Italy, constitute two of its most valuable divisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These volumes form Nos. 151, 152 and 153 of the Family

Little and James Brown. 1842.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a bold and eloquent attack on the doctrines of the
Bible, by one who avows himself to be a Christian minister,
and is ordained and settled over a religious congregation.
Some of the readers of Mr. Parker’s “Discourse”
who are unacquainted with the writings of the German
rationalists, may fancy that he is a man of deep research
and profound scholarship; but there is little danger that an
intelligent student in theology will be so deceived. The
work embraces the substance of five lectures, delivered in
Boston during the last autumn. The author denies the inspiration
of the Holy Scriptures, the divinity of Jesus Christ,
and most of the other ideas of what he terms the “popular
theology.” We leave him and his labors to the critics of
the Christian churches.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a sequel to the entertaining volume published
under the same title last year. Though “Masterman
Ready” is an entertaining story, it is far from being equal
in any respect, save its freedom from the coarser kind of
jests, to “Peter Simple,” “Jacob Faithful,” or the other

</div>

<p class='pindent'>One of the best of Miss Sedgwick’s smaller works. It

Pp. 232. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The pleasant little volume entitled “Wealth and Worth,”
which we commended to our readers a month or two since,
has been succeeded by another work from the same pen,
which we think even superior to its predecessor. It is a
story of American life, conveying, as its piquant title
indicates, a useful and impressive moral. The style is
animated and pure, and the sketches of character are
graphic, forcible, and various; while the plot preserves a
deep and natural interest. “Wealth and Worth” has
gone through five large editions in the course of as many
months—a remarkable instance of rapidly attained popularity.
A success equally decided must attend the spirited
little tale of “What’s to be Done?”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
